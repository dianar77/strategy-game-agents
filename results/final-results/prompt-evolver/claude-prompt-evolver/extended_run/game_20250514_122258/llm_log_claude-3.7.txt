PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Initial Settlement Placement Analysis

I need to carefully analyze the best location for my first settlement based on the optimal ore-wheat strategy. Let's examine the board and identify the best options.

## Resource Analysis
First, I'll look for high-probability hexes, especially ore and wheat:

**High-Value Hexes:**
- ⛏️8 (0,0,0) - Ore with 5 dots (excellent)
- 🌾6 (-1,0,1) - Wheat with 5 dots (excellent)
- 🌾6 (1,1,-2) - Wheat with 5 dots (excellent)
- ⛏️8 (1,0,-1) - Sheep with 5 dots (good)
- 🌾9 (-1,2,-1) - Wheat with 4 dots (good)

## Node Value Analysis
Looking at nodes at the intersection of high-value hexes:

- Node 3: Connects to ⛏️8, 🌾6, and 🌲2 (ore + wheat + wood!) - excellent pips (10 dots)
- Node 0: Connects to ⛏️8, 🌾11, and 🐑8 (ore + wheat + sheep) - good pips (9 dots)
- Node 20: Connects to 🐑8, 🌾6, and 🌾11 (wheat + sheep) - good pips (9 dots)

## Port Considerations
While ports are valuable, they're secondary to securing high-production spots in the initial placement.

## Opponent Positioning
RED player has already placed at node 4, which produces ore, wheat, and sheep. Since they've taken one of the prime spots, I need to secure another high-value location.

## Decision
Node 3 is clearly the best option. It gives me:
1. Access to the highest value ore hex (8 - 5 dots)
2. Access to a high value wheat hex (6 - 5 dots)
3. Some wood production (2 - 1 dot)
4. Total pip count of 10
5. Sets up perfectly for the ore-wheat strategy

<plan>
1. Place first settlement at node 3 to secure high-value ore and wheat production
2. For second settlement, target another ore or wheat hex on the opposite side of the board 
3. Prioritize city upgrades after securing necessary resources
4. Focus on building towards the ore port at nodes 48, 49
</plan>

Looking at the available actions, Node 3 corresponds to action [2].

\boxed{2}

# Analyzing Initial Road Placement for Blue Player

I need to decide on the first road placement for my initial settlement, which will determine my early expansion options. Let me analyze each available option:

## Current Settlement Analysis
- I have a settlement at node 2 that produces:
  - ⛏️ Ore on 8 (excellent probability)
  - ⛏️ Ore on 12 (poor probability)
  - 🌲 Wood on 2 (poor probability)
- My settlement is strong on ore but lacks wheat and has poor wood income

## Available Road Options:
[0] Edge (2, 3): Moving east
[1] Edge (2, 9): Moving southwest
[2] Edge (1, 2): Moving west

## Analyzing Direction by Direction:

### Option 0: Build road at edge (2, 3)
- Leads toward node 3, which connects to:
  - 🌾 Wheat on 6 (excellent probability)
  - ⛏️ Ore on 8 (excellent probability I already have)
- This direction supports the ore-wheat strategy
- Could potentially build toward the wheat hex with number 6
- Also keeps options open for expansion

### Option 1: Build road at edge (2, 9)
- Leads toward node 9, which connects to:
  - 🌲 Wood on 2 (poor probability I already have)
  - ⛏️ Ore on 12 (poor probability I already have)
  - 🐑 Sheep on 10 (moderate probability)
- This doesn't help diversify my resources and leads to resources I already have

### Option 2: Build road at edge (1, 2)
- Leads toward node 1, which connects to:
  - ⛏️ Ore on 8 (excellent probability I already have)
  - ⛏️ Ore on 12 (poor probability I already have)
  - 🐑 Sheep on 8 (excellent probability)
- Would allow access to sheep but duplicates ore I already have

## Decision:
Option 0 is clearly the best choice as it:
1. Leads toward node 3 which has a high-value wheat hex (6)
2. Supports my ore-wheat strategy by potentially getting me wheat access
3. Provides better expansion options toward diverse resources
4. Points me in the direction of new resources rather than duplicating what I have

<plan>
1. Build first road toward node 3 to gain access to wheat hex with number 6
2. For second settlement, target a location with good wheat production on the opposite side of the board
3. Focus on balancing ore and wheat production through my two settlements
4. After initial setup, prioritize city upgrades over additional settlements
5. Build roads only to reach critical settlement spots for resource diversity
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 1 | Player: BLUE | Action: BUILD_INITIAL_SETTLEMENT

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build first road toward node 3 to gain access to wheat hex with number 6
2. For second settlement, target a location with good wheat production on the opposite side of the board
3. Focus on balancing ore and wheat production through my two settlements
4. After initial setup, prioritize city upgrades over additional settlements
5. Build roads only to reach critical settlement spots for resource diversity
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Initial Settlement Analysis for the Ore-Wheat Strategy

I need to pick my second initial settlement to optimize my ore-wheat strategy. Let's analyze the board carefully to find the best location.

## Key Considerations:
1. High-value ore and wheat hexes (numbers 6, 8, 5, 9)
2. Maximize pip count (probability)
3. Resource diversity (cover all 5 resources if possible)
4. Placement on opposite side of board from first settlement
5. Future expansion potential

## Current Status:
- My first settlement is at node 2, producing Ore (8), Ore (12), Wood (2)
- Red's settlement is at node 4, producing Ore (8), Wheat (6), Sheep (5)
- I already have access to Ore and Wood, but need Wheat, Sheep, and Brick

## Best Candidates Analysis:

Looking at the board, the best nodes to consider are those that:
1. Have wheat (my strategy priority)
2. Provide resources I'm missing
3. Are on the opposite side of the board

Node 21: Connects to Wheat (11), Wheat (9), and Wood (3) - excellent wheat production but lacks resource diversity
Node 19: Connects to Wheat (11), Wheat (6), Wood (3) - two wheat hexes with a good number (6)
Node 20: Connects to Wheat (11), Wheat (6), Sheep (8) - excellent production and resource diversity
Node 16: Connects to Wheat (9), Wheat (11), Sheep (5) - good wheat production and resource diversity
Node 14: Connects to Wheat (6), Ore (5), Sheep (10) - well-balanced with ore-wheat focus

After analysis, node 20 stands out as the optimal choice because:
- It produces from high-value Wheat (6 - high probability)
- It produces from Wheat (11) and Sheep (8)
- It provides access to 2 of my missing resources
- It's on the opposite side of the board from my first settlement
- It has 8 total pips (dots) across its production numbers
- It positions me well for future expansion toward the ore port

<plan>
1. Place second settlement at node 20 for strong wheat and sheep production
2. Build roads toward ore port (nodes 48-49) for optimal ore trading
3. Focus on upgrading both settlements to cities as quickly as possible
4. Target additional settlement at a brick-producing location
5. Trade sheep for resources needed for city upgrades
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I select action #13 to build my second initial settlement at node 20.

5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 1 | Player: BLUE | Action: BUILD_INITIAL_ROAD

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Place second settlement at node 20 for strong wheat and sheep production
2. Build roads toward ore port (nodes 48-49) for optimal ore trading
3. Focus on upgrading both settlements to cities as quickly as possible
4. Target additional settlement at a brick-producing location
5. Trade sheep for resources needed for city upgrades

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan - Initial Road Placement

I need to decide where to place my initial road from my second settlement at node 20. This decision will shape my early expansion opportunities and resource access.

## Resources and Position Assessment
- I have settlements at:
  - Node 2: Produces ore (8 & 12) and wood (2)
  - Node 20: Produces wheat (11 & 6) and sheep (8)
- I already have good ore, wheat and sheep production
- I'm missing reliable brick and wood production
- My current resources: 1 sheep, 2 wheat

## Road Placement Options
Let me analyze each option:

[0] Build road at edge (0, 20):
- Direction: Toward node 0, which connects to ore (8), sheep (8), and wheat (11)
- Future benefit: Could expand toward the center, but this area is already covered by my production

[1] Build road at edge (19, 20):
- Direction: Toward node 19, which connects to wheat (11) and wood (3)
- Future benefit: Provides route toward low-probability wood (3)

[2] Build road at edge (20, 22):
- Direction: Toward node 22, which connects to sheep (8), brick (3), and potentially the ore port
- Future benefit: Creates path toward 2:1 ore port (nodes 48, 49) and brick (3) production

## Strategic Decision
Following the ore-wheat strategy, I should position myself to maximize ore and wheat production and trading efficiency. Option [2] is clearly superior because:

1. It creates a path toward the 2:1 ore port, which will be crucial for my ore-wheat strategy
2. It gives me access to brick (3) production which I'm currently lacking
3. It positions me away from the center, reducing the chance of being blocked

<plan>
1. Build road toward node 22 to create path to ore port and brick production
2. Focus on gathering resources to upgrade both settlements to cities ASAP
3. Use the ore port to optimize ore trading efficiency
4. Target a third settlement at a brick/wood producing location when possible
5. Continue city-focused strategy with development cards for flexibility
</plan>

This road placement aligns with my original plan and strengthens my position for executing the ore-wheat strategy.

# Game Analysis: Turn 3 Decision

Let me analyze my current situation:

## Current Resources
- 2 🐑 SHEEP
- 3 🌾 WHEAT
- 1 ⛏️ ORE

## Victory Point Status
- I have 2 VP (from two settlements)
- Opponent has 2 VP (from two settlements)

## Production Capabilities
- Settlement at node 2: ⛏️8 (high probability), ⛏️12 (low probability), 🌲2 (very low probability)
- Settlement at node 20: 🌾11 (medium probability), 🐑8 (high probability), 🌾6 (high probability)

## Current Plan Assessment
My current plan focuses on building toward the ore port and upgrading settlements to cities. I have good wheat production but limited brick and wood, which matches the ore-wheat strategy.

## Action Options
1. Buy development card (1 🐑, 1 🌾, 1 ⛏️)
2. End turn

## Decision Logic
- Following the ore-wheat strategy, development cards are valuable for potential VP cards or knights
- I have exactly the resources needed for a development card
- I'm getting early in the game to establish resource control
- Drawing a knight would help protect my high-value hexes and work toward largest army
- Drawing a VP card would give me a hidden advantage
- Drawing Year of Plenty or Monopoly could help me gather resources for city upgrades

According to my strategy:
1. Cities are the top priority, but I don't have enough resources yet
2. Development cards provide flexibility and potential hidden VP
3. I have excess sheep that aren't critical to my core strategy
4. Drawing development cards early maximizes their utility over the game

<plan>
1. Buy development cards when excess resources are available
2. Continue saving ore and wheat for city upgrades as top priority
3. Build road toward node 22 to create path to ore port when resources allow
4. Improve brick and wood production with a strategic third settlement
5. Upgrade settlements to cities as soon as possible
</plan>

Since I can't build a city yet but have the perfect combination for a development card, the optimal move is to buy a development card.

- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 5 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Buy development cards when excess resources are available
2. Continue saving ore and wheat for city upgrades as top priority
3. Build road toward node 22 to create path to ore port when resources allow
4. Improve brick and wood production with a strategic third settlement
5. Upgrade settlements to cities as soon as possible

❓ Select action by number (0-1):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze my options step by step to make the most strategic decision for winning with the ore-wheat strategy.

### Current Game State Analysis:
- I have 2 VP from my settlements
- My resources: 1 sheep, 3 wheat
- I have 1 knight development card
- It's turn 5, early game
- I have good wheat production but mediocre ore production
- The robber is on a desert hex, not affecting anyone's production

### Option 0: Play Knight Card
**Pros:**
- Could move the robber to block RED's ore hex (8) which is their best production
- Could potentially steal a useful resource from RED
- Would get me 1/3 of the way to largest army (2 VP)
**Cons:**
- Knights are more valuable later when protecting my own high-value hexes
- The robber is currently not affecting anyone's production
- If I roll a 7 soon, I'd waste this opportunity

### Option 1: Roll the Dice
**Pros:**
- Could gain more resources for my build strategy
- Save my knight for when I really need it
- The robber is currently in a harmless position
**Cons:**
- Risk of rolling 7 and having to discard if I get too many resources

### Strategy Evaluation:
Following my ore-wheat strategy, my priority is to get cities as quickly as possible. Currently, I don't have any ore, and I need 3 ore + 2 wheat for my first city. Rolling gives me a chance to collect more resources, especially ore which I'm lacking.

Playing the knight now would be premature since the robber isn't affecting my production. It's better to save it for when I need to protect my ore/wheat hexes or when I'm closer to earning largest army.

My plan remains focused on:
1. Collecting ore and wheat for city upgrades
2. Using development cards strategically rather than immediately

<plan>
1. Continue saving ore and wheat for city upgrades as top priority
2. Buy development cards when excess resources are available
3. Build road toward node 22 to access ore port when resources allow
4. Save knight cards for protecting high-value hexes or competing for largest army
5. Upgrade settlements to cities as soon as possible
</plan>

Based on this analysis, the optimal action is to roll the dice to gain more resources.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!

RESPONSE:
# Game Analysis

I'll analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action based on the ore-wheat strategy.

## Current Situation
- I have 1 sheep, 3 wheat, and 1 knight development card
- My settlements are at nodes 2 (produces ore, ore, wood) and 20 (produces wheat, sheep, wheat)
- The robber is currently on (-2, 0, 2) which is a desert hex, so not affecting anyone
- RED player has 5 hidden cards and could be planning their next move

## Available Actions
- [0] Play Knight card - Move robber and steal a resource
- [1] End my turn

## Strategic Considerations
1. I don't have enough resources to build anything this turn - no city (need 3 ore, 2 wheat), no road (need wood+brick), no settlement (need wood+brick+wheat+sheep), no development card (need ore+wheat+sheep)
2. Playing a knight would let me potentially steal a needed resource from RED
3. RED has 5 cards - they're likely preparing for a significant build
4. Based on our ore-wheat strategy, I need ore most urgently

## Knight Card Analysis
If I play the knight card:
- I can move the robber to a high-value ore hex, potentially disrupting RED's production
- I can steal one of RED's 5 cards, hopefully getting ore
- I'll make progress toward the Largest Army (2 VP)
- I'll protect my high-value hexes from the robber on upcoming turns

Looking at the board, RED's settlement at node 4 produces from the ore hex with an 8 (very high probability). This is an ideal target for my knight.

<plan>
1. Play knight to move robber to (0,0,0) - the ore hex with value 8 that RED is collecting from
2. Continue saving ore and wheat for city upgrades as top priority
3. Use future wheat and sheep production to buy development cards
4. Build road toward node 22 to access ore port when resources allow
5. Upgrade settlements to cities as soon as possible
</plan>

Given my lack of building resources and RED's vulnerable position, playing the knight card is strategically beneficial to both disrupt RED's production and potentially gain needed ore.

- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 5 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Play knight to move robber to (0,0,0) - the ore hex with value 8 that RED is collecting from
2. Continue saving ore and wheat for city upgrades as top priority
3. Use future wheat and sheep production to buy development cards
4. Build road toward node 22 to access ore port when resources allow
5. Upgrade settlements to cities as soon as possible
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Analysis of Robber Placement Options

I need to choose the most strategic location to place the robber based on the ore-wheat strategy:

## Key Decision Factors:
1. Disrupt RED's production (currently leading with 5 resources)
2. Target high-probability hexes (6s and 8s especially)
3. Target ore and wheat hexes to block resources critical to my strategy
4. Steal a valuable resource from RED if possible

## Examining Target Hexes:
- Option [0]: Move robber to (0, 0, 0) - ⛏️8 ore hex
  * High-value ore hex with probability 8 (5 dots)
  * Blocks RED's settlement at node 4 (high production)
  * Blocks my own settlement at node 2 (drawback)
  * Can steal from RED

- Option [3]: Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) - 🌾6 wheat hex
  * High-value wheat hex with probability 6 (5 dots)
  * Blocks RED's settlement at node 4
  * Doesn't block any of my production
  * Can steal from RED

- Option [6]: Move robber to (1, 0, -1) - 🐑8 sheep hex
  * High-value sheep hex with probability 8 (5 dots) 
  * Blocks RED's settlement at node 23
  * Also blocks my settlement at node 20 (drawback)
  * Can steal from RED

## Strategic Decision:
Option [3] is optimal because:
1. It targets a critical wheat hex (vital for the ore-wheat strategy)
2. It has a high probability (6 - five dots)
3. It blocks RED's production without affecting my own
4. I can steal from RED, potentially getting wheat or ore

<plan>
1. Move robber to wheat hex (-1, 0, 1) to block RED's high-value wheat production
2. Continue saving ore and wheat for city upgrades as top priority
3. Use future wheat and sheep production to buy development cards
4. Build road toward node 22 to access ore port when resources allow
5. Upgrade settlements to cities as soon as possible
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)

- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 7 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:

# Game State Analysis

## Current Resources and Position
- I have 2 🐑SHEEP and 4 🌾WHEAT
- No ORE or other resources
- 2 victory points (2 settlements)
- Robber is currently on wheat hex (-1, 0, 1), blocking RED's high-value wheat production
- My settlements:
  - Node 2: produces ⛏️8[⭐⭐⭐], ⛏️12, 🌲2 (good ore production)
  - Node 20: produces 🌾11[⭐], 🐑8[⭐⭐⭐], 🌾6[⭐⭐⭐] (excellent wheat and sheep)
- RED has 5 hidden resource cards

## Strategic Options
1. **End Turn**: Save my resources for future city upgrades or development cards. I need ORE to upgrade settlements to cities.
2. **Maritime Trade**: Trading 4 WHEAT for 1 resource. Options:
   - Trading for ORE would be most aligned with my city-focused strategy
   - But the ratio is very inefficient (4:1)

## Decision Analysis
- My ore-wheat strategy prioritizes upgrading settlements to cities ASAP
- I need 3 ORE + 2 WHEAT for a city upgrade
- I already have 4 WHEAT but 0 ORE
- Trading 4 WHEAT for 1 ORE would give me 1 ORE but leave me with 0 WHEAT
- This would put me far from the 3 ORE + 2 WHEAT needed for a city
- Better to hold my 4 WHEAT for future use once I collect ORE naturally

Since I have a strong ore hex (⛏️8), I'll likely get ore production soon. It's more efficient to wait rather than trade at the unfavorable 4:1 ratio. My city-building strategy will progress faster if I end my turn and wait for natural production.

<plan>
1. End turn and wait for natural ore production from my 8-value ore hex
2. Continue saving wheat and sheep for city upgrades and development cards
3. Consider development card purchase if I get ore but not enough for a city
4. Still aim to build road toward node 22 to access ore port when resources allow
5. Upgrade settlements to cities as soon as I have 3 ore + 2 wheat

2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 9 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. End turn and wait for natural ore production from my 8-value ore hex
2. Continue saving wheat and sheep for city upgrades and development cards
3. Consider development card purchase if I get ore but not enough for a city
4. Still aim to build road toward node 22 to access ore port when resources allow
5. Upgrade settlements to cities as soon as I have 3 ore + 2 wheat

# Game Analysis - Turn 9

Let me carefully analyze the current game state and determine the optimal move for my ore-wheat strategy.

## Current Resources
I have:
- 3 🐑 SHEEP
- 4 🌾 WHEAT
- 2 ⛏️ ORE

## Victory Point Status
- I have 2 VPs from 2 settlements
- Red also has 2 VPs

## Available Actions
1. End turn
2. Buy a development card (1 🐑, 1 🌾, 1 ⛏️)
3. Various maritime trades that don't align with my strategy

## Strategic Analysis

The core of my ore-wheat strategy is to upgrade settlements to cities as quickly as possible. For a city upgrade, I need 3 ore and 2 wheat.

I currently have:
- 2 ore (need 1 more for a city upgrade)
- 4 wheat (more than enough for a city)

My options:

1. **Buy a development card**: This would use 1 sheep, 1 wheat, and 1 ore, leaving me with 2 sheep, 3 wheat, and 1 ore. This would delay my city upgrade and use one of my precious ore. However, it could yield a VP card, knight (for largest army), or utility cards.

2. **End turn**: This preserves my current resources and positions me to upgrade to a city as soon as I get one more ore. My 8-value ore hex is high probability, so natural production is likely in upcoming turns.

3. **Maritime trade**: Trading 4 wheat for 1 ore would allow me to immediately upgrade a settlement to a city. However, this is a very poor trade ratio and doesn't align with my strategy of preserving wheat for city building.

## Decision
The optimal play is to buy a development card. Here's why:
1. I already have a settlement with high wheat production (8+6+11 pips on wheat)
2. I'm likely to get more wheat naturally in upcoming turns
3. Development cards provide flexibility and hidden victory points
4. I might get a knight to protect my ore production or a VP card
5. Using one ore now doesn't significantly delay my city upgrade plans

<plan>
1. Buy a development card now to potentially gain VP or knight
2. Continue saving resources for city upgrades (need 1 more ore after the purchase)
3. Build roads toward node 22 to access ore port when resources allow
4. Upgrade settlements to cities as soon as I have 3 ore + 2 wheat
5. Consider building a third settlement only after at least one city
</plan>

\boxed{1}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze my current situation carefully to make the optimal move for my ore-wheat strategy.

## Current Game State
- I'm BLUE with 2 VP
- I have 2 🐑SHEEP, 3 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE
- I have 1 played KNIGHT card (contributing to largest army)
- My settlements are well-positioned on ore/wheat hexes (one on 8/12 ore, another on 6/11 wheat)
- Robber is currently on the 6 wheat hex at (-1,0,1), blocking one of RED's production spots
- RED has 7 hidden resources - they may be planning a big move

## Available Options
1. **Buy a development card** (1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE) - This would use all my resources
2. **End my turn** - Save resources for a city upgrade later

## Key Considerations

I need to analyze if buying a development card now is better than saving resources for a city:

**Option 1: Buy Development Card**
- Pros:
  - Could get a VP card (immediately hidden progress)
  - Could get another knight (moving closer to largest army - 2VP)
  - Could get Road Building/Year of Plenty/Monopoly cards to potentially accelerate city building
  - Uses my sheep which isn't critical for city building
- Cons:
  - Uses my only ore, delaying city upgrade
  - I'll need to gather 3 more ore + 2 more wheat for a city afterwards

**Option 2: Save Resources**
- Pros:
  - Closer to a city upgrade (needing just 2 more ore)
  - Cities are the core of my strategy for exponential resource growth
- Cons:
  - Risk losing resources to a 7 roll
  - No immediate progress this turn
  - Holding 6 cards makes me vulnerable to robberies

## Decision Analysis

Following the ore-wheat strategy, city upgrades are priority. However, I already have:
1. One knight played (moving toward largest army)
2. Good ore and wheat production
3. A risk of resource loss if I hold too many cards

Getting another development card now could provide:
- More knights for largest army (2VP)
- VP card (direct progress)
- Utility cards to help get resources for cities

Given I need 2 more ore after this purchase, and I already have good production capacity, buying a development card now advances my long-term strategy while making use of sheep (which isn't critical for cities).

<plan>
1. Buy a development card now to work toward largest army or direct VP
2. Focus on gathering ore for city upgrades (need 2 more ore after this purchase)
3. Build roads toward the ore port (node 48/49) when resources allow
4. Upgrade settlements to cities as soon as I have 3 ore + 2 wheat
5. Build a third settlement only after at least one city upgrade
</plan>

The development card purchase aligns with my strategy of building toward cities while making progress each turn. It also uses sheep effectively, which is not my primary strategic resource.

- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis: Turn 11 of Catan

I'll analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action as part of my ore-wheat strategy.

## Current Situation
- I'm BLUE with 2 VP (2 settlements)
- RED has 3 VP (1 settlement, 1 city)
- I have 1 sheep, 1 wheat, and 2 knight cards (1 already played)
- The robber is on a wheat hex (0, 1, -1) that produces on 11, blocking one of my key wheat hexes
- My production: Good wheat (6), poor wheat (11 - blocked), good sheep (8), good ore (8), and some low-value resources

## Decision Analysis

I have two options:
1. Play a knight card - This would let me move the robber away from my wheat hex and steal a resource from RED
2. Roll the dice - Standard resource production, but my wheat hex remains blocked

Playing a knight would:
- Remove the robber from my wheat hex, improving my wheat production
- Allow me to steal a random resource from RED
- Move me closer to largest army (I'd have 2 knights played, need 1 more)
- Help protect my key hexes from future robber placement

Rolling the dice would:
- Maintain the status quo with the robber blocking my wheat production
- Save my knight card for later, when it might be more strategically valuable

## Strategic Impact

My plan focuses on the ore-wheat strategy to build cities. With the robber on my wheat hex, my city-building capability is significantly hampered. Removing this blocker would accelerate my progress toward upgrading settlements to cities.

Additionally, stealing a resource from RED (who is ahead with 3 VP) could provide an immediate benefit while setting me up for better production in future turns.

<plan>
1. Play knight card now to unblock my wheat hex and steal from RED
2. Focus on gathering ore for city upgrades (need 3 ore)
3. Build roads toward the ore port (node 48/49) when resources allow
4. Upgrade settlements to cities as soon as I have 3 ore + 2 wheat
5. Build a third settlement only after at least one city upgrade
</plan>

Since I'm committed to the ore-wheat strategy, removing any obstacle to wheat production is critical. Playing the knight card is clearly the optimal move.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return

# Analyzing the Game State

I need to carefully consider where to place the robber for maximum strategic advantage after playing my knight card. Let's analyze the situation step by step:

## Current Game State
- I have 2 VP (2 settlements)
- RED has 3 VP (1 settlement, 1 city)
- RED has 0 visible cards (hidden)
- I have 1 sheep, 1 wheat in hand and 1 knight card to play
- The robber is currently on hex (0, 1, -1), which is a wheat hex with number 11
- My settlement at node 20 produces from this wheat hex, so moving the robber helps unblock my own production

## Opponent Analysis
RED's buildings:
- City at node 4 produces from ore8, wheat6, sheep5 (high-value city)
- Settlement at node 23 produces from sheep8, brick3, wood4

## Strategic Priorities
1. Block RED's most valuable resource production
2. Target resources I need for my city upgrade strategy (ore)
3. Potentially steal a resource from RED

## Robber Placement Options Analysis

Looking at RED's highest value production:
- Ore8 (hex 0,0,0) - This is a high-probability hex (3 dots) that RED's city benefits from
- Wheat6 (hex -1,0,1) - Another high-probability hex (2 dots) that RED's city produces from
- Sheep8 (hex 1,0,-1) - High-probability hex that RED's settlement produces from

I also need to consider my own production:
- My settlement at node 2 produces from Ore8
- My settlement at node 20 produces from Wheat11 (currently blocked), Sheep8, and Wheat6

The most impactful targets would be:
1. [0] Move robber to (0,0,0) - Blocks ore8, affects RED's city production, but also blocks my own settlement production
2. [3] Move robber to (-1,0,1) - Blocks wheat6, affects RED's city without hurting my production much
3. [5] Move robber to (1,0,-1) - Blocks sheep8, affects both RED's settlement and my settlement

Since my strategy is ore-wheat focused, I need to prioritize blocking RED's access to these resources. The ore hex is particularly valuable, but blocking it hurts my own production too. 

The wheat6 hex (option 3) is a great target since:
1. It blocks a high-probability wheat hex that RED's city produces from
2. It doesn't block my ore production which is critical
3. It has minimal impact on my own wheat production as I have two wheat-producing hexes
4. It targets RED's city, which is more valuable than targeting their settlement

<plan>
1. Move robber to wheat6 hex (-1,0,1) to block RED's city production
2. Continue focus on gathering ore for city upgrades (need 3 ore)
3. Build roads toward the ore port (node 48/49) when resources allow
4. Upgrade settlements to cities as soon as I have 3 ore + 2 wheat
5. Build a third settlement only after at least one city upgrade
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I'll place the robber on the wheat6 hex to disrupt RED's city production without hurting my own ore production.

4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 11 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Move robber to wheat6 hex (-1,0,1) to block RED's city production
2. Continue focus on gathering ore for city upgrades (need 3 ore)
3. Build roads toward the ore port (node 48/49) when resources allow
4. Upgrade settlements to cities as soon as I have 3 ore + 2 wheat
5. Build a third settlement only after at least one city upgrade
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis for Blue Player (Turn 11)

Let me analyze my current position and available options:

## Current Game State
- I have 2 VP (2 settlements)
- RED has 3 VP (1 settlement + 1 city)
- I have 2 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE
- I have 1 KNIGHT development card
- I've already played 2 KNIGHT cards
- The robber is on (-1, 0, 1) which is a wheat hex with value 6

## Resources Analysis
My settlements produce:
- Settlement at node 2: ⛏️8 (good), ⛏️12 (poor), 🌲2 (poor)
- Settlement at node 20: 🌾11 (okay), 🐑8 (good), 🌾6 (good)

I have good wheat and sheep production, but inconsistent ore production.

## Strategic Options
I can either:
1. Buy a development card (1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE) - Action [1]
2. End my turn - Action [0]

## Decision Analysis
Buying a development card would:
- Potentially give me a VP card (immediate progress)
- Or a Knight (I already have 2 played, so a 3rd would give me Largest Army = 2 VP)
- Or a Year of Plenty or Monopoly (both helpful for my ore-wheat strategy)
- Use all my current resources, leaving me without resources for trading next turn

Ending my turn would:
- Allow me to accumulate more resources on the next round
- Keep my options open for potential trades or builds
- Delay my progress toward 10 VP

## Ore-Wheat Strategy Consideration
In my ore-wheat strategy, development cards are valuable, especially when I already have 2 knights played. Getting the Largest Army (2 VP) would put me at 4 VP total and ahead of RED.

<plan>
1. Buy a development card now - if it's a Knight, play it next turn to get Largest Army
2. Focus on getting ore to upgrade a settlement to a city (need 3 ore + 2 wheat)
3. Target the settlement at node 20 for upgrading first (produces good wheat)
4. Build toward ore port (nodes 48/49) when resources allow
5. Continue evaluating RED's progress to maintain competitive advantage
</plan>

Following the ore-wheat strategy, buying a development card is the optimal move. I already have 2 knights played, so getting a 3rd knight would give me Largest Army (2 VP). Even if I don't get a knight, any development card is valuable in this strategy.

# Game Analysis for Turn 13

I need to carefully consider my options as I pursue the ore-wheat city-building strategy.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 2 VP (2 settlements)
- RED has 3 VP (1 settlement + 1 city)
- I have 2 sheep, 1 ore, 1 Knight card, and 1 Monopoly card
- I've already played 2 Knight cards (one more will give me Largest Army = 2 VP)
- The robber is currently on a wheat hex (-1,0,1), which is a 6 (high-value)

## My Available Actions
1. Play Monopoly targeting one resource type
2. Play Knight to move robber and steal
3. Roll the dice

## Option Analysis

### Playing Monopoly
- RED has 3 hidden cards
- If I use Monopoly, I'm aiming to get resources I need for a city (3 ore + 2 wheat)
- If I choose ore and RED has multiple ore cards, this could be very beneficial
- However, I don't know what RED has, making this a risky play
- Monopoly would be more valuable later after a high-probability roll

### Playing Knight
- Would move the robber from the wheat hex
- Could steal a resource from RED
- Would give me 3 played knights = Largest Army (2 VP)
- Increases my VP from 2 to 4, putting me ahead of RED

### Rolling
- Standard play, but I'll need to get lucky with the right resources
- If I roll a 7, I can move the robber and potentially steal from RED

## Decision Logic

The Knight play is extremely valuable right now because:
1. It immediately gives me Largest Army (2 VP)
2. It puts me at 4 VP total, ahead of RED
3. I can move the robber from the wheat hex to a more advantageous position
4. I can steal a resource from RED

<plan>
1. Play Knight now to get Largest Army (2 VP) and steal a resource
2. Move the robber to RED's high-value ore hex (0,0,0) with probability 8
3. Continue accumulating ore and wheat to build a city
4. Target the settlement at node 20 for upgrading first (produces good wheat)
5. Save Monopoly for a strategic opportunity after high-probability rolls
</plan>

Playing Knight card is clearly the optimal move to gain 2 VP from Largest Army.

4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 13 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Play Knight now to get Largest Army (2 VP) and steal a resource
2. Move the robber to RED's high-value ore hex (0,0,0) with probability 8
3. Continue accumulating ore and wheat to build a city
4. Target the settlement at node 20 for upgrading first (produces good wheat)
5. Save Monopoly for a strategic opportunity after high-probability rolls

# Game Analysis: Settlers of Catan Turn 13

I need to analyze the game state and make a key decision about where to move the robber. Let me analyze the options carefully.

## Current Game Assessment:
- I'm BLUE with 4 VP (2 settlements, largest army)
- RED has 3 VP (1 settlement, 1 city)
- I have 2 sheep, 1 ore, and 1 Monopoly card
- I need ore and wheat for city upgrades (my top priority in ore-wheat strategy)
- I just played a Knight card triggering this robber move

## Robber Placement Strategy:
The best robber placement should:
1. Disrupt RED's highest value resource production
2. Target resources I need most (ore and wheat)
3. Affect multiple settlements/cities if possible
4. Target RED's best production to slow them down

## Analyzing Key Options:

Option [0]: Move to (0, 0, 0) - ORE with probability 8
- This blocks RED's city which produces ore on an excellent 8 probability
- Disrupts RED's best resource production
- Ore is critical for my city-building strategy
- Will steal a card from RED

Option [5]: Move to (1, 0, -1) - SHEEP with probability 8
- Blocks a hex that produces for both RED and myself
- While sheep is useful, it's not my priority resource

Option [4]: Move to (0, 1, -1) - WHEAT with probability 11
- Blocks my own wheat production at node 20
- This would hurt my ore-wheat strategy significantly

Option [16]: Move to (2, 0, -2) - BRICK with probability 3
- Low probability hex (3)
- Brick isn't critical for my ore-wheat strategy

## Decision Analysis:
The ore hex at (0, 0, 0) is clearly the optimal choice because:
1. It has a high probability (8)
2. It blocks RED's city which is their most productive building
3. Ore is critical for my city-building strategy
4. I can steal a resource from RED
5. It doesn't impact my own production

<plan>
1. Move robber to RED's high-value ore hex (0,0,0) to disrupt their city production
2. Continue accumulating ore and wheat to build a city
3. Target the settlement at node 20 for upgrading first (produces good wheat)
4. Save Monopoly for strategic use after high probability rolls
5. Next development card acquisition when excess sheep available
</plan>

Based on my analysis, I'll move the robber to RED's high-value ore hex (0,0,0) and steal a resource from them.

\boxed{0}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes

2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action based on my ore-wheat strategy.

## Current Game State
- I have 4 VP (2 from settlements + 2 from largest army)
- I have 3 sheep and 2 ore resources
- I have 1 Monopoly development card
- RED has 3 VP (1 settlement + 1 city + 0 from largest road)
- The robber is on an ore hex at (0,0,0), which is a high-value 8 tile
- My settlements: node 2 (produces ore 8, ore 12, wood 2) and node 20 (produces wheat 11, sheep 8, wheat 6)

## Strategic Assessment
The robber is already on a valuable ore hex at (0,0,0), which happens to produce for both RED's city and my settlement at node 2. Since I'm following an ore-wheat strategy, this is hurting my production of ore.

My options are:
1. Play Monopoly for a specific resource
2. Roll the dice

### Monopoly Options Analysis
- Wood: Not crucial for my city-building strategy
- Brick: Not crucial for my city-building strategy
- Sheep: I already have 3 sheep, and it's not my priority resource
- Wheat: Critical resource for city building that I currently don't have
- Ore: Critical resource for city building that I need more of (have 2, need 3 for a city)

Looking at RED's high-value city at node 4, they produce from a wheat hex with value 6. There's a good chance they may have some wheat in their 3 hidden resource cards.

### City Building Analysis
I need 3 ore + 2 wheat to upgrade a settlement to a city. I currently have 2 ore, so I'm still missing 1 ore and 2 wheat.

<plan>
1. Use Monopoly to acquire wheat from RED
2. Roll dice to collect more resources, especially aiming for more ore
3. Prioritize upgrading the settlement at node 20 to a city (great wheat producer)
4. Continue building toward ore port at nodes 48-49 for better ore trading
5. Save for another development card when resources allow
</plan>

## Decision
The ore hex with value 8 is currently blocked by the robber, which hurts my production. With the ore-wheat strategy, wheat is the resource I'm most likely missing and RED probably has some (given their wheat-producing city).

The optimal play is to use Monopoly to take all wheat from RED to boost my city-building resources.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis: Robber Placement Decision

I need to determine the optimal hex to place the robber that will best support my ore-wheat strategy while hindering my opponent.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 4 VP (2 settlements + 2 VP from largest army)
- Resources: 3 sheep, 1 wheat, 2 ore
- The robber is currently on (0,0,0) - the ore hex with value 8
- RED has 3 VP (1 settlement + 1 city)

## Robber Placement Analysis
I need to consider:
1. Moving the robber OFF my valuable resource (currently blocking my ore)
2. Blocking RED's highest value hexes
3. Stealing a potentially useful resource from RED

Looking at RED's production:
- RED's city at node 4 produces: Ore(8), Wheat(6), Sheep(5) - very strong production
- RED's settlement at node 23 produces: Sheep(8), Brick(3), Wood(4) - weaker production

## Best Robber Placement Options

Option 5: Move to (1,0,-1) Sheep(8) - This blocks both RED's settlement AND my own Wheat(6)/Sheep(8) production at node 20. Not ideal as it hurts me too.

Option 2: Move to (-1,0,1) Wheat(6) - This blocks RED's city's wheat production (6) without affecting my production, and lets me steal from RED.

Option 3: Move to (-1,1,0) Sheep(5) - This blocks RED's city's sheep production, but it's only a 5, so less impactful.

Option 16: Move to (2,0,-2) Brick(3) - Blocks RED's settlement's brick production, but brick is less valuable and it's only a 3.

Option 17: Move to (2,-1,-1) Wood(4) - Blocks RED's settlement's wood production, but wood is less valuable.

## Decision Logic
The clear best choice is option 2, moving the robber to (-1,0,1) - the wheat hex with value 6:
- It blocks RED's city's wheat(6) production (high value)
- Wheat is a critical resource for the ore-wheat strategy
- It doesn't block any of my production
- I get to steal a card from RED
- Moving the robber off my ore hex unblocks my ore production

<plan>
1. Block RED's wheat production to slow down their city building
2. Roll dice to collect resources, especially newly unblocked ore
3. Prioritize upgrading settlement at node 20 to a city (need 3 ore, 2 wheat)
4. Continue building toward ore port at nodes 48-49 for better ore trading
5. Save for development cards when excess resources allow
</plan>

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return

- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played

- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

# Game Analysis

I'll carefully analyze the current game state and available options to determine the most optimal action.

## Current Game State Assessment:
- I have 4 VP (2 settlements + 2 VP from largest army)
- I have 4 sheep, 1 wheat, 2 ore
- RED has 3 VP (1 settlement + 1 city + 0 bonus VP)
- RED has a city at a strong location (8 ore, 6 wheat, 5 sheep)
- The robber is currently on the 6 wheat hex, blocking RED's wheat production

## Resources Analysis:
- To upgrade a settlement to a city, I need 3 ore + 2 wheat
- I currently have 2 ore + 1 wheat
- I need 1 more ore and 1 more wheat
- I have excess sheep (4)

## Strategic Options:

1. **End my turn** (Action 0):
   - No progress this turn
   - Not aligned with my ore-wheat strategy
   - The robber stays on RED's wheat, which is good for me

2. **Buy a development card** (Action 1):
   - Cost: 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore
   - This leaves me with 3 sheep, 0 wheat, 1 ore
   - Potential benefits: VP card, knight (to protect my hexes), resource cards
   - Drawbacks: Uses my only wheat and reduces my ore, pushing me further from a city upgrade

3. **Trade 4 sheep for 1 wheat** (Action 2):
   - This gives me 2 wheat total (with 0 sheep remaining)
   - Would have wheat requirement for city, but still short 1 ore
   - Most efficient sheep trade for my city strategy

4. **Trade 4 sheep for 1 ore** (Action 3):
   - This gives me 3 ore total (with 0 sheep remaining)
   - Would have ore requirement for city, but still short 1 wheat
   - Second-most efficient sheep trade for my city strategy

5-6. **Trade sheep for wood/brick** (Actions 4-5):
   - Not aligned with my ore-wheat strategy
   - No immediate benefit for city building

## Strategic Decision:

Looking at my current plan, I need to prioritize upgrading my settlement to a city. I'm missing 1 ore and 1 wheat. I could either:

1. Trade for a resource now (wheat or ore), then hope to get the other on future rolls
2. Buy a development card that might give me resources or protection

The ore-wheat strategy emphasizes upgrading to cities ASAP. I have excess sheep, and I should convert them to needed resources. Between wheat and ore, wheat is more useful now since I'm closer to having enough ore (2/3) than wheat (1/2).

<plan>
1. Trade excess sheep for wheat to prepare for city upgrade
2. Continue blocking RED's wheat production with robber
3. Roll for more resources next turn, focusing on getting the missing 1 ore for city
4. Upgrade settlement at node 20 to city as soon as possible (need one more ore)
5. Continue building toward ore port at nodes 48-49 for better ore trading after city build
</plan>

Considering the ore-wheat strategy and my current resources, I'll trade my excess sheep for wheat to get closer to building a city.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 19 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze my current situation and available actions:

## Current State:
- I have 4 VP (2 from settlements, 2 from largest army)
- I have 4 wheat and 2 ore resources
- My strategic plan focuses on upgrading a settlement to a city (needs 3 ore + 2 wheat)
- The robber is currently blocking a wheat hex (🌾6)

## Resource Analysis:
- I need 1 more ore to upgrade my settlement at node 20 to a city
- I have excess wheat (4) but not enough ore (2) for the city upgrade

## Available Actions:
- [0] End my turn - no build actions possible with current resources
- [1-4] Trade 4 wheat for 1 of another resource using the default 4:1 port rate

## Strategic Decision:

Looking at my options, I need to decide whether to trade or end my turn:

1. Trading 4 wheat for 1 ore would give me exactly what I need to upgrade to a city, which is my priority according to the ore-wheat strategy.

2. Ending my turn would mean hoping for ore on my next roll, but risks losing resources to a 7 roll or having my plans disrupted by other players.

Given that city upgrades are the core of the ore-wheat strategy and I'm just 1 ore away from achieving this critical milestone, trading is the optimal choice.

<plan>
1. Trade 4 wheat for 1 ore to reach 3 ore total
2. Immediately build a city at node 20 (my wheat-producing settlement)
3. Continue protecting my resources with knights and focus on getting resources for a third settlement
4. Look to build toward the ore port (nodes 48-49) in future turns
</plan>

The best action is to trade 4 wheat for 1 ore:

# Game Analysis and Decision Making

Let me analyze the current game state and make a strategic decision:

## Current Game Status:
- I have 4 VP (2 from settlements, 2 from largest army)
- RED has 3 VP (1 from settlement, 2 from city)
- I have 1 sheep, 1 wheat, and 4 ore in my resources
- My current plan is to trade 4 wheat for 1 ore and build a city, but I need to reconsider since I now have 4 ore

## Resource Analysis:
- I already have 4 ore
- I only need 1 more wheat to build a city (costs 3 ore, 2 wheat)
- Node 20 is one of my wheat-producing settlements and upgrading it to a city would greatly increase my wheat production

## Action Evaluation:

**Option 0: End Turn**
- This wastes resources and delays my city-building strategy
- Not optimal when I'm close to building a city

**Option 1: Buy Development Card**
- Costs 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore
- Would leave me with 3 ore, 0 wheat
- Could give me a VP card, knight, or other useful card
- But delays my city upgrade goal

**Option 2-4: Trade for Sheep/Wood/Brick**
- These resources aren't needed for my current city-building strategy
- Not aligned with the ore-wheat strategy

**Option 5: Trade 4 ore for 1 wheat**
- This would give me 0 ore, 2 wheat
- I won't be able to build a city this turn
- This is a poor use of my ore
- Very inefficient trade and contradicts my strategy

Actually, I see the problem now. I don't have enough resources to build a city this turn regardless of what action I take. I need to reconsider my strategy.

<plan>
1. Buy a development card this turn using 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore (leaves me with 3 ore)
2. Development card might give me a VP or another knight to strengthen largest army
3. Next turn, focus on acquiring 2 wheat to complete a city upgrade at node 20
4. Continue with city-focused strategy afterward
</plan>

The most strategic move is to purchase a development card, which could potentially be a victory point card, strengthening my position while I gather the additional wheat needed for a city next turn.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

I need to analyze the current game state and make the optimal move based on my city-focused "ore-wheat strategy".

## Current State Assessment:
- I have 4 VP (2 settlements + 2 from Largest Army)
- I have 2 wheat and 3 ore in hand
- I need 10 VP to win
- Red has 3 VP (1 settlement + 1 city + 1 longest road)

## My Available Resources:
- 2 🌾 WHEAT
- 3 ⛏️ ORE
- This is exact amount needed for a city upgrade

## Available Actions:
0. End turn
1. Upgrade settlement at node 2 to a city
2. Upgrade settlement at node 20 to a city

## Analysis of City Upgrade Options:

### Option 1: Upgrade at node 2
- Current production: ⛏️8 (high value), ⛏️12 (low value), 🌲2 (very low value)
- This node produces ore but very little else of value
- Poor probability on two of the three hexes

### Option 2: Upgrade at node 20
- Current production: 🌾11 (decent), 🐑8 (high value), 🌾6 (high value)
- This node produces excellent wheat (two high-value wheat hexes)
- Much better overall productivity with higher probability numbers

## Strategic Decision:
According to my city-focused strategy, I should prioritize upgrading settlements to cities as quickly as possible. Between the two options, node 20 is clearly superior because:

1. It produces wheat on two high-probability hexes (6 and 11)
2. Wheat is critical for my strategy (city upgrades, development cards)
3. The production value at node 20 is significantly higher than at node 2
4. I already have another settlement producing ore (at node 2)

<plan>
1. Upgrade settlement at node 20 to city this turn
2. Focus on acquiring more ore and wheat for next city upgrade at node 2
3. After both cities are built, consider buying development cards for potential VPs
4. Look for opportunity to build a new settlement for resource diversification
</plan>

The optimal move is to upgrade my settlement at node 20 to a city, which will double my wheat production on those valuable hexes.

# Strategic Analysis for Moving the Robber

Let me analyze the optimal placement for the robber to advance my ore-wheat strategy.

## Game State Assessment
- I have 5 VP (1 city, 1 settlement, Largest Army, 1 VP card)
- RED has 3 VP (1 city, 1 settlement)
- I currently have only 2 wheat cards
- My current city at node 20 produces wheat (twice) and sheep
- My settlement at node 2 produces ore (mostly) but at lower frequency numbers

## Robber Placement Considerations
1. **Target high-probability hexes**: Look for 6s and 8s
2. **Block RED's resources**: Focus on their best production
3. **Prioritize ore/wheat production**: These are critical for my city strategy
4. **Steal opportunity**: Maximize chance to get a useful resource

Looking at RED's buildings:
- City at node 4 produces ore (8), wheat (6), sheep (5) - this is very strong production
- Settlement at node 23 produces sheep (8), brick (3), wood (4)

The ore hex at (0,0,0) with value 8 is especially valuable as it produces for both RED's city and my settlement at node 2. This is an optimal target because:
1. It blocks RED's strongest production (ore from an 8)
2. It gives me a chance to steal from RED (potentially getting ore/wheat)
3. Even though it blocks my own ore production, the damage to RED is greater than to me

<plan>
1. Block RED's ore production at (0,0,0) and steal a card
2. Continue focusing on gathering ore and wheat for upgrading node 2 to a city
3. After the city upgrade, look to build roads toward valuable settlement locations
4. Consider development cards when excess sheep are available
</plan>

Given the priority of disrupting RED's economy and potentially stealing a valuable resource, the best action is to move the robber to (0,0,0) and steal from RED.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze the current game state and determine the optimal robber placement as part of my ore-wheat strategy.

## Current Game State
- I'm BLUE with 5/10 VP (1 settlement, 1 city, largest army bonus, 1 hidden VP card)
- RED has 3/10 VP (1 settlement, 1 city)
- My resources: 1 wood, 4 wheat
- The robber is currently on (0,0,0) which is an ore hex with value 8

## Robber Placement Strategy
I need to maximize my chances of winning by:
1. Disrupting RED's resource production
2. Protecting my own valuable hexes
3. Stealing a useful resource

Looking at RED's buildings:
- City at node 4: produces ore(8★★★), wheat(6★★★), sheep(5★★)
- Settlement at node 23: produces sheep(8★★★), brick(3★), wood(4★)

The most impactful hexes for RED are:
- Ore(8) at (0,0,0) - currently blocked
- Wheat(6) at (-1,0,1) - high probability and connected to their city
- Sheep(8) at (1,0,-1) - high probability

## Analyzing My Options
Option 2: Move robber to (-1,0,1) and steal from RED
- This blocks RED's wheat(6★★★) production from their city
- Wheat is critical for the ore-wheat strategy
- RED has 6 cards, giving me a good chance to steal something valuable

Option 5: Move robber to (1,0,-1) and steal from RED
- This blocks RED's sheep(8★★★) production
- Less impactful for my strategy than blocking wheat

I should also check if any options block hexes that produce for both of us:
- None of my productive hexes are shared with RED

<plan>
1. Move robber to (-1,0,1) to block RED's wheat production and steal a card
2. Continue gathering ore and wheat to upgrade my settlement at node 2 to a city
3. After city upgrade, build roads toward valuable settlement locations
4. Look for development card opportunities when I have excess sheep
</plan>

The most strategic move is to block RED's wheat production, as wheat is critical for city building. By targeting their high-probability wheat hex, I directly impede their city-building capabilities while potentially stealing a valuable resource.

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

I need to analyze my current position and determine the optimal action to advance my ore-wheat strategy.

## Current Game State
- I have 5/10 victory points (1 settlement, 1 city, largest army, 1 VP card)
- Resources: 2 wood, 4 wheat
- The robber is currently on (-1,0,1), blocking RED's wheat production
- I need 3 ore to upgrade my settlement at node 2 to a city (which would give me 7/10 VP)

## Evaluating Available Actions

0. **End Turn**
   This would waste my 4 wheat and 2 wood resources without making progress.

1-4. **Maritime Trade Options**
   All options involve trading 4 wheat for 1 of another resource:
   - Option 1: Get 1 brick
   - Option 2: Get 1 ore
   - Option 3: Get 1 sheep
   - Option 4: Get 1 wood

Looking at my ore-wheat strategy, my priority is upgrading my settlement to a city, which requires 3 ore. I currently have 0 ore, so option 2 (trading for 1 ore) would be the most aligned with my strategy.

My settlement at node 2 produces ore on an 8 hex (good probability), but I need to accumulate enough ore now to make progress. Trading 4 wheat for 1 ore isn't ideal efficiency, but:

1. I have excess wheat (4)
2. The standard maritime trade rate is 4:1
3. I need ore specifically for my city upgrade
4. Making progress toward cities is the core of my strategy

<plan>
1. Trade 4 wheat for 1 ore to start accumulating resources for my city upgrade
2. Continue focusing on ore and wheat production to upgrade my settlement at node 2 to a city
3. After the city upgrade, consider building roads toward valuable settlement locations
4. Look for development card opportunities when I have excess sheep
</plan>

While a 4:1 trade is inefficient, it's better to make progress toward my city upgrade than to do nothing this turn. I need a total of 3 ore for the city, so this is a step in the right direction. I'll still have 2 wood for future road building.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 37 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Trade 4 wheat for 1 ore to start accumulating resources for my city upgrade
2. Continue focusing on ore and wheat production to upgrade my settlement at node 2 to a city
3. After the city upgrade, consider building roads toward valuable settlement locations
4. Look for development card opportunities when I have excess sheep
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze my current position and available actions:

**Victory Points (5/10):**
- 1 Settlement (1 VP)
- 1 City (2 VP)
- Largest Army (2 VP)
- 1 Victory Point card (hidden)

**Resources:**
- 2 Wood
- 4 Wheat
- 1 Ore

**Strategic Position:**
- I'm following the ore-wheat strategy, which focuses on upgrading to cities.
- I have a settlement at node 2 producing ore (8 & 12) and wood (2).
- I have a city at node 20 producing wheat (11 & 6) and sheep (8).
- The robber is currently on hex (-1, 0, 1), which is a wheat 6 hex.

## Available Actions
My available actions are:
0. End my turn
1. Trade 4 wheat for 1 brick
2. Trade 4 wheat for 1 ore
3. Trade 4 wheat for 1 sheep
4. Trade 4 wheat for 1 wood

## Decision Process
For a city upgrade, I need 3 ore and 2 wheat. I currently have:
- 1 ore (need 2 more)
- 4 wheat (sufficient)

According to my ore-wheat strategy, upgrading settlements to cities is the highest priority. Trading 4 wheat for 1 ore makes sense as it contributes directly to my city goal. While this is an expensive trade (4:1), I have excess wheat but am severely short on ore.

Given my settlement at node 2 already produces ore from high-probability hexes (8 and 12), upgrading this to a city would significantly improve my ore production.

If I trade 4 wheat for 1 ore:
- I'll have 2 ore (need 1 more for a city)
- I'll still have 0 wheat (need 2 more for a city)
- But increased ore production will help with future builds

<plan>
1. Trade 4 wheat for 1 ore to continue accumulating resources for city upgrade
2. Prioritize upgrading my settlement at node 2 to a city to boost ore production
3. After obtaining enough resources (3 ore, 2 wheat), upgrade settlement to city
4. Consider development cards if excess sheep becomes available
</plan>

Given my analysis and my focus on the ore-wheat strategy, trading for ore is my best action.

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

I need to analyze my current position and make the best strategic decision to advance my "ore-wheat strategy" toward victory.

## Current Game State Assessment:
- I have 5/10 victory points (1 settlement, 1 city, largest army bonus, 1 hidden VP card)
- Resources: 1 wood, 2 sheep, 1 wheat, 3 ore
- My opponent RED has 3/10 victory points with more roads but fewer development cards

## Resource Analysis:
- My city at node 20 produces wheat (11,6) and sheep (8) - excellent production
- My settlement at node 2 produces ore (8) - critical for city upgrades
- I lack consistent wood and brick production
- I have accumulated 3 ore already, which positions me well for my next city upgrade

## Available Actions:
0. End turn
1. Buy a development card (1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore)

## Strategic Reasoning:
Buying a development card aligns with my ore-wheat strategy for several reasons:
- It could provide another VP card (bringing me to 6/10 VP)
- More knights would strengthen my largest army position
- Year of Plenty or Monopoly could help secure resources for my next city upgrade
- I already have 3 ore, so using just 1 still leaves me with 2 toward my city upgrade

I currently need 2 more ore and 2 wheat for a city upgrade, so using 1 ore and 1 wheat now would delay that slightly. However, the potential benefit of another VP card or helpful action card is significant.

<plan>
1. Buy development card to potentially get a VP or strategic card
2. Continue accumulating resources for city upgrade at node 2
3. After upgrade, focus on getting a third settlement at a strategic location for missing resources
4. Continue pursuing largest army and potentially longest road
</plan>

Given my strong ore position and the potential strategic benefits of development cards in the ore-wheat strategy, I'll buy a development card.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

2. Continue accumulating resources for city upgrade at node 2
3. After upgrade, focus on getting a third settlement at a strategic location for missing resources

# Game Analysis: Turn 45

I need to decide whether to play a Knight card or roll the dice. Let me analyze the current game state and my options carefully.

## Current Status
- I have 5 victory points: 1 settlement (1 VP) + 1 city (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 1 VP card
- Resources: 1 wood, 3 sheep, 3 ore
- Development cards: 1 knight, 1 victory point
- I need 5 more victory points to win

## Option Analysis

### Option 0: Play Knight Card
**Advantages:**
- Increases my knight count to 4, further securing my largest army bonus
- Can move the robber away from the wheat hex at (1, 1, -2) that's currently blocked
- Can potentially steal a useful resource from RED
- Thins my hand before rolling (I have 7 cards, would go down to 6)

**Disadvantages:**
- I already have largest army, so playing another knight doesn't directly gain me points
- Using my knight now means I won't have it for defense if I roll a 7 later

### Option 1: Roll the Dice
**Advantages:**
- Could gain more resources to build with
- Keeps the knight in hand for future defensive use
- Is the standard progression of a turn

**Disadvantages:**
- I have 7 cards, so rolling a 7 would force me to discard half my hand
- The robber is on a wheat hex that I produce from, so I'm blocked from getting wheat

## Strategic Consideration

Looking at my resources (1 wood, 3 sheep, 3 ore), I'm just 1 wheat away from being able to build my city upgrade at node 2 (need 3 ore + 2 wheat). Moving the robber off my wheat hex would give me a chance to produce wheat on subsequent rolls.

Additionally, I'm at risk of losing cards if I roll a 7 since I have exactly 7 cards. Playing the knight now would reduce my hand size to 6 cards, protecting my resources.

<plan>
1. Play knight to move robber off wheat hex at (1,1,-2)
2. Steal a resource (preferably wheat) from RED
3. Roll and collect resources
4. Prioritize city upgrade at node 2 if I can get wheat
5. If not, consider buying development card or building roads toward future settlement locations
</plan>

Given the risk of losing cards to a 7 roll and the benefit of unblocking my wheat production, playing the Knight card is the most strategic choice.

# Game Analysis for Robber Placement

I need to decide on the optimal robber placement as part of my ore-wheat strategy. Let me analyze the options carefully:

## Current Game State
- I have 5/10 VP (1 settlement, 1 city, largest army bonus, 1 VP card)
- My resources: 1 wood, 3 sheep, 3 ore
- I'm moving the robber after playing a knight card
- RED has 4/10 VP and 4 hidden resource cards

## Robber Placement Strategy
Looking at RED's settlements and cities:
- RED has a city at node 4 producing ore(8), wheat(6), sheep(5) - high value spot!
- RED has settlements at nodes 23 (sheep(8), brick(3), wood(4)) and 17 (sheep(5), ore(5), brick(4))

The most valuable hexes for RED are:
1. Ore(8) hex at (0,0,0) - crucial for city building
2. Wheat(6) hex at (-1,0,1) - important for cities and development cards
3. Sheep(8) hex at (1,0,-1) - high production value

My goal should be to:
1. Block RED's highest-value resources (especially ore/wheat)
2. Target a hex where I can steal a resource from RED
3. Protect my own high-value hexes

## Decision Analysis
Based on the ore-wheat strategy, I should prioritize blocking RED's access to ore or wheat:
- Option [0]: Block ore(8) at (0,0,0) and steal from RED - excellent choice
- Option [3]: Block wheat(6) at (-1,0,1) and steal from RED - also strong

Option [0] is optimal because:
- It blocks RED's high-value ore hex (probability 5/36)
- RED's city is on this hex, doubling its production value
- This same hex produces for my settlement at node 2
- I already have 3 ore, so I'm not desperate for more
- Blocking RED's ore slows their city-building potential

<plan>
1. Move robber to ore(8) hex at (0,0,0) and steal from RED
2. Roll and collect resources
3. If I get wheat, prioritize city upgrade at node 2
4. If not, consider buying development card if I get wheat from RED
5. Work toward settlement expansion to gain more wheat production
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 45 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Move robber to ore(8) hex at (0,0,0) and steal from RED
2. Roll and collect resources
3. If I get wheat, prioritize city upgrade at node 2
4. If not, consider buying development card if I get wheat from RED
5. Work toward settlement expansion to gain more wheat production
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis for Turn 45

I'll evaluate the current game state and determine the best action for the BLUE player.

## Current Situation
- I have 5/10 VP: 1 settlement (1 VP) + 1 city (2 VP) + Largest Army (2 VP) + 1 VP card
- Resources: 1 Wood, 3 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 3 Ore
- RED has 4/10 VP
- The robber is on the ore hex at (0,0,0) - blocking one of my ore production nodes (node 2)

## Available Actions
1. Buy a development card (1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore)
2. End turn

## Decision Analysis

The ore-wheat strategy focuses on upgrading to cities quickly. I currently have:
- 1 city at node 20 (producing wheat and sheep)
- 1 settlement at node 2 (primarily ore when not blocked)

If I buy a development card, I'll spend:
- 1 Sheep (leaving 2)
- 1 Wheat (leaving 0)
- 1 Ore (leaving 2)

Benefits of buying a development card:
1. Potential VP card (immediate progress toward 10 VP)
2. Knight (can move robber off my ore hex, strengthen largest army)
3. Progress cards (year of plenty, monopoly, road building)

Considering my ore-wheat strategy, development cards provide multiple benefits:
- Protecting my ore production if I get a Knight
- Potential direct VP
- Resource acquisition (Year of Plenty, Monopoly)

Looking at my current resources, I can't build a city (need 2 more wheat and 0 more ore). I can't build a settlement (need 1 brick, 1 wood, 1 wheat, 1 sheep). My only productive action is buying a development card.

<plan>
1. Buy a development card
2. If it's a Knight, use it to move robber off my ore hex
3. If it's a VP card, save it for final turn
4. Continue focusing on getting wheat to build my next city at node 2
5. Consider settlement expansion once I have more cities
</plan>

Given my current resources and the ore-wheat strategy, buying a development card is the optimal play. It advances my strategy by potentially giving me another victory point, a knight to unblock my ore production, or progress cards to help get resources needed for city building.

# Analyzing the Game State

Let me thoroughly analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action for the ore-wheat strategy.

## Current Game Status
- I have 5 Victory Points (1 settlement + 1 city + 2 VP from largest army + 1 VP card)
- Resources: 1 Wood, 2 Sheep, 2 Ore
- Development cards: 1 Road Building, 1 Victory Point card
- Red has 4 Victory Points

## Options Analysis

### Option 0: Play Road Building Card
- This would allow me to build two roads for free
- My current plan focuses on getting resources for city upgrades
- Roads would help me expand to new settlement locations, but I don't currently have the resources to build settlements

### Option 1: Roll the Dice
- Rolling gives me a chance to collect more resources
- I need wheat for my city upgrade plan (upgrade settlement at node 2)
- It's risky if I roll a 7 with 5 cards in hand

## Strategic Considerations
1. The robber is currently on my ore hex (0,0,0) with number 8, blocking my best ore production
2. I need wheat for my city upgrade plan - rolling could give me wheat
3. Road Building is valuable, but better saved for when I have resources to build settlements after placing the roads

<plan>
1. Roll to collect resources, particularly wheat
2. If I get wheat, work toward upgrading settlement at node 2 to a city
3. If I get blocked by the robber again, use Road Building next turn to expand toward new resource spots
4. Continue prioritizing city upgrades before new settlements
5. Look for opportunities to expand toward wheat production
</plan>

Rolling seems more aligned with my current goal of gathering resources for a city upgrade. The Road Building card will be more valuable when I have resources to build a settlement after placing roads.

Therefore, the optimal action is to roll the dice.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 47 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Roll to collect resources, particularly wheat
2. If I get wheat, work toward upgrading settlement at node 2 to a city
3. If I get blocked by the robber again, use Road Building next turn to expand toward new resource spots
4. Continue prioritizing city upgrades before new settlements
5. Look for opportunities to expand toward wheat production
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game State Analysis

Let me carefully analyze the current game situation and my available actions:

## Current Position
- I have 5/10 victory points (1 settlement, 1 city, largest army bonus, 1 hidden VP card)
- Resources: 1 wood, 4 sheep, 2 ore
- Development cards: 1 Road Building card, 1 Victory Point card
- The robber is on the ore hex (0,0,0) which is one of my production spots
- Red has 4 VP and 4 hidden resource cards

## Resource Needs
For my ore-wheat strategy, I need:
- For a city upgrade: 3 ore + 2 wheat (I have 2 ore, need 1 more ore and 2 wheat)
- For a new settlement: 1 brick, 1 wood, 1 wheat, 1 sheep (I have 1 wood, 4 sheep)

## Action Analysis

**Option 0: Play Road Building**
- I could place two free roads to expand toward better resource spots
- This would help me prepare for future settlement placement
- Potential targets: expanding from node 2 or 20 toward new settlement locations

**Options 2-5: Maritime Trade**
- I could trade 4 sheep for 1 wheat, ore, wood, or brick
- But trading at 4:1 is very inefficient

**Option 1: End Turn**
- Simply end turn and hope for better rolls next time
- Not taking any action means no progress this turn

## Strategic Decision Making

Looking at my current plan, I want to upgrade my settlement at node 2 to a city. However, I lack wheat completely. Trading 4 sheep for 1 wheat at this point is inefficient and still wouldn't give me enough wheat for a city.

The robber is currently on one of my ore hexes, limiting my ore production. Given this constraint and my need to expand my resource diversity, playing Road Building is the most strategic choice. I should use it to position myself for a new settlement that can produce wheat, since I currently only have one settlement and one city.

<plan>
1. Play Road Building to expand from node 2 toward better resource spots
2. Target settlement locations that can produce wheat
3. Continue working toward upgrading settlement at node 2 to a city once I have resources
4. Consider development card purchases if I get excess sheep/wheat/ore
5. Keep focusing on city upgrades and strategic expansion
</plan>

I'll use Road Building to expand my options and position myself for a new settlement that can help with my resource needs, particularly wheat.

# Analyzing Game State and Available Options

## Game Status Assessment
- I have 5/10 victory points (1 settlement = 1 VP, 1 city = 2 VP, largest army = 2 VP)
- Hidden VP from development card = 1 VP, so actually 6/10 VP total
- Current resources: 1 wood, 4 sheep, 2 ore (lacking brick and wheat)
- I have the largest army bonus (4 knights played)
- Need 4 more VP to win, potentially through:
  - Upgrading my settlement to a city (+1 VP)
  - Building more settlements (+1 VP each)
  - Getting more VP development cards

## Resource Production Analysis
- My settlement at node 2: produces ore (8), ore (12), wood (2) - great ore production
- My city at node 20: produces wheat (11), sheep (8), wheat (6) - excellent wheat/sheep production
- Note: The robber is on the 8-ore hex, blocking the best ore production
- While I have the key resources for the ore-wheat strategy (ore and wheat), my ore production is currently hampered

## Road Building Options Analysis
Looking at the available road building options:

[0] (1, 2): This connects toward node 1, which could lead to nodes on the 8-ore hex and sheep
[1] (0, 20): This connects toward central nodes, including access to the 8-ore hex
[2] (3, 4): This heads toward wheat (6) and sheep (5) hexes
[3] (19, 20): This connects toward nodes on wheat (11) and wood (3) hexes
[4] (22, 49): This heads toward the ore port and wheat (6) hex
[5] (22, 23): This connects to node 23 (already RED's settlement)
[6] (2, 9): This heads toward brick (11) and sheep (10) hexes
[7] (3, 12): This heads toward brick (11), sheep (10), and wheat (6) hexes

## Strategic Considerations
1. I need brick for road building, which I currently lack
2. I don't have resources to build anything immediately, so I should prepare for future turns
3. With my ore-wheat strategy, I should prioritize:
   - Getting more ore/wheat production
   - Expanding toward valuable spots that RED hasn't claimed yet
   - Setting up for future city upgrades (need 3 ore + 2 wheat)

## Decision
Since I currently lack brick, I can't immediately build roads. But I need to choose a direction for future expansion.

Option [0] (edge 1, 2) looks promising because:
- It heads toward high-value resource nodes, particularly more access to the 8-ore hex
- It creates potential settlement locations that complement my strategy
- It keeps my expansion options open

<plan>
1. Save resources for road and settlement expansion toward node 1
2. Focus on getting brick through trades or production
3. Work toward upgrading my settlement at node 2 to a city
4. Continue buying development cards when excess resources are available
5. Target reaching 3 cities + 2 settlements + largest army for 10 victory points
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Analyzing the Game State

Let me analyze the current situation:

## Current Victory Points (5/10)
- 1 Settlement (1 VP)
- 1 City (2 VP)
- Largest Army bonus (2 VP)
- 1 Victory Point card (hidden)

## Resources Available
- 1 Wood
- 4 Sheep
- 2 Ore
- (No Brick or Wheat)

## Strategic Analysis

1) I currently lack brick, which means I can't build any roads this turn despite having wood.

2) Looking at my settlements:
   - Settlement at node 2 produces ore (8, highest probability), ore (12, lowest), and wood (2, low)
   - City at node 20 produces wheat (11, medium), sheep (8, high), wheat (6, high)

3) My current plan mentions expanding toward node 1, but I need brick.

4) Development cards:
   - I already have largest army with 4 knights
   - I have 1 VP card hidden
   - Only need 4 more VP to win

Let's reconsider my options:

- Cannot build roads without brick
- Cannot build settlements without roads to new locations
- Cannot upgrade my settlement at node 2 without wheat (need 2 more wheat and 1 more ore)
- Could buy a development card with my sheep, ore and wheat if I had wheat

Since I can't perform any building actions with my current resources, I need to end my turn. None of the options 0-8 are actually feasible right now since all are road-building options requiring brick, which I don't have.

<plan>
1. Trade for or produce brick to build roads toward valuable expansion spots
2. Continue saving ore for city upgrade at node 2
3. Acquire wheat for city upgrades and development cards
4. Target 3 cities (6 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
5. Consider using the ore port if I accumulate excess ore
</plan>

Since I cannot perform any of the listed actions due to lacking brick, I need to end my turn, but I don't see that as an option in the given list. All options 0-8 are for building roads, which I cannot do without brick.

However, since I'm required to select one of the listed options, I'll analyze which road would be most strategic if I could build it:

Option 8 (1, 6) would expand toward potential settlement spots and open access to the ore port.

But since I can't actually build any roads now, I must assume the problem expects me to select an action even if I can't perform it.

# Game Analysis for Blue Player - Turn 47

I'll analyze the current game state to determine the best action based on the ore-wheat strategy.

## Current Status
- **Victory Points**: 5/10 (1 settlement, 1 city, largest army, 1 hidden VP)
- **Resources**: 1 Wood, 4 Sheep, 2 Ore
- **Development Cards**: 1 VICTORY_POINT card (hidden)

## Strategic Assessment

Looking at my resources, I have 4 sheep, which isn't immediately useful for the city-focused strategy. My current plan indicates saving ore for a city upgrade at node 2, which requires 3 ore and 2 wheat. I currently have 2 ore but no wheat.

The robber is on the ore hex (0,0,0) with number 8, which is hindering my high-value ore production from my settlement at node 2.

### Options Analysis:

1. **Trade 4 sheep for 1 wheat (Option 1)**
   - Would give me 1 wheat toward the 2 wheat needed for a city
   - Aligned with my ore-wheat strategy
   - Still need 1 more wheat and 1 more ore for a city

2. **Trade 4 sheep for 1 ore (Option 2)**
   - Would give me 3 total ore, getting closer to the 3 needed for a city
   - Still need 2 wheat for a city

3. **Trade 4 sheep for 1 wood (Option 3)**
   - Not aligned with my city-focused strategy
   - Wood is less valuable for my current plan

4. **Trade 4 sheep for 1 brick (Option 4)**
   - Could help build roads toward expansion
   - Mentioned in my plan, but city upgrades have higher priority

5. **End turn (Option 0)**
   - Conserve resources for future turns
   - Could wait to roll better combinations

## Decision Logic

Since my primary goal is to upgrade settlements to cities as quickly as possible (per the ore-wheat strategy), I need to focus on acquiring both ore and wheat.

Looking at my immediate priorities:
- I need 1 more ore and 2 wheat for a city upgrade
- Currently have excess sheep (4) which aren't essential for cities

Trading for wheat makes strategic sense because:
1. Wheat is essential for city upgrades
2. I have no wheat currently
3. Starting to accumulate the resources needed for my next city

<plan>
1. Trade sheep for wheat now to begin gathering city resources
2. Continue saving ore for city upgrade at node 2 (need 1 more ore, 1 more wheat)
3. Next turns: acquire remaining ore and wheat through production or trades
4. Maintain target of 3 cities (6 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
</plan>

I'll trade my excess sheep to start accumulating the wheat I need for my city strategy.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 57 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Trade sheep for wheat now to begin gathering city resources
2. Continue saving ore for city upgrade at node 2 (need 1 more ore, 1 more wheat)
3. Next turns: acquire remaining ore and wheat through production or trades
4. Maintain target of 3 cities (6 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.
  To adjust your plan, provide a NEW PLAN in your reasoning with <plan>your new plan</plan>

# Analysis of the Game State

I'll assess my current situation to make the optimal choice for advancing my ore-wheat strategy.

## Current Game Status
- I'm BLUE with 5/10 VP (1 settlement + 1 city + largest army + 1 VP card)
- RED has 5/10 VP (3 settlements + 1 city)
- Resources: 1 wood, 2 sheep, 3 wheat, 2 ore
- I control largest army with 4 knights played

## Current Resource Analysis
- I have 2 ore + 3 wheat + 2 sheep + 1 wood
- For a city upgrade, I need 3 ore + 2 wheat (I'm 1 ore short)
- For a development card, I need 1 ore + 1 wheat + 1 sheep (I have enough)

## Option 1: End Turn
If I end my turn, I'll keep all my resources for next turn and could potentially collect the remaining ore I need to build a city through production.

## Option 2: Buy Development Card
Spending 1 ore + 1 wheat + 1 sheep would leave me with 1 ore, 2 wheat, 1 sheep, and 1 wood. 
Possible outcomes:
- Draw a VP card (would put me at 6/10)
- Draw a knight (strengthen largest army lead)
- Draw a helpful development card (Road Building, Year of Plenty, Monopoly)

## Strategic Considerations
1. My priority per my ore-wheat strategy is city-building
2. I'm 1 ore short of upgrading node 2 to a city
3. If I buy a development card, I delay my city upgrade
4. However, a VP card would advance me to 6/10 VP immediately
5. Knight cards help maintain my largest army advantage
6. With 5 VP cards total in the deck and 18 cards remaining, probability of drawing a VP is modest

## Current Plan Assessment
My current plan prioritizes city upgrades, particularly at node 2. Buying a development card would delay this but might advance my VP count directly.

<plan>
1. Buy a development card now for potential VP card or knight card value
2. Next turn, focus on acquiring the additional ore needed (either through production or trades)
3. Upgrade settlement at node 2 to a city when resources allow
4. Continue development card strategy for hidden VP and largest army protection
5. Target path: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
</plan>

Since I already have sufficient resources for city building except for 1 ore, and I have a strong position with largest army, buying a development card now represents the best opportunity for advancement. It might give me an immediate VP or strengthen my largest army lead.

The probability of getting value from a development card is high, and doing so now when I can't yet build a city is optimal timing.

❓ Select action by number (0-1):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state to determine the optimal action.

## Game State Analysis

**Current Victory Points (5/10):**
- 1 settlement (1 VP)
- 1 city (2 VP)
- Largest Army (2 VP)
- 1 Victory Point card (hidden) (1 VP)
- Need 5 more VPs to win

**Resources Available:**
- 1 🌲Wood, 1 🐑Sheep, 2 🌾Wheat, 1 ⛏️Ore

**Important Board Considerations:**
- I have a settlement at node 2 that I want to upgrade to a city
- I already have the largest army with 4 knights
- I control an ore-producing settlement that can yield ore on roll of 8 or 12
- My city on node 20 produces wheat and sheep well (6 and 8)

## Action Options

**Option 1: Buy a Development Card**
- Costs 1 🐑Sheep, 1 🌾Wheat, 1 ⛏️Ore
- Possible outcomes:
  - Knight (helps maintain largest army)
  - Victory Point card (gets me closer to winning)
  - Year of Plenty (could help get needed resources)
  - Monopoly (could be useful later)
  - Road Building (less useful for my strategy)

**Option 0: End Turn**
- Save resources for next turn
- Need 2 more ore and 1 more wheat to upgrade settlement to city
- But I'd be holding 5 cards without making progress

## Strategic Evaluation

Looking at my current plan:
1. Buy a development card now
2. Next turn, focus on acquiring additional ore
3. Upgrade settlement at node 2 to a city
4. Continue development card strategy
5. Target path: 3 cities + largest army + 2 VP cards = 10 VP

Buying a development card now aligns perfectly with my plan. It:
- Uses my current resources efficiently
- Might yield a victory point card (bringing me to 6/10 VP)
- Maintains my ore-wheat strategy without wasting cards
- Reduces my hand size before dice are rolled again
- Supports my hidden VP and largest army protection strategy

<plan>
1. Buy development card now (potentially increasing my hidden VP)
2. Next turn, focus on acquiring the 2 additional ore and 1 wheat needed
3. Upgrade settlement at node 2 to a city as soon as resources allow
4. Continue development card strategy for hidden VP and largest army protection
5. Target path: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2+ VP cards = 10+ VP
</plan>

Therefore, I should buy a development card.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 59 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Buy development card now (potentially increasing my hidden VP)
2. Next turn, focus on acquiring the 2 additional ore and 1 wheat needed
3. Upgrade settlement at node 2 to a city as soon as resources allow
4. Continue development card strategy for hidden VP and largest army protection
5. Target path: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2+ VP cards = 10+ VP
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis for Turn 59

Let me analyze the current game state and my options carefully.

## Current Status
- I am BLUE with 5 VP (1 settlement + 1 city + largest army + 1 hidden VP card)
- I have 2 knight cards and 1 VP card in hand
- I currently have only 1 wood and 1 wheat as resources
- RED has 7 VP (3 settlements + 1 city + longest road)
- RED has 5 hidden resource cards

## My Options
**[0] Play Knight card**: This would let me move the robber and steal a resource from RED.
**[1] Roll the dice**: Normal turn progression, generate resources based on the roll.

## Reasoning
1. The robber is currently on the ore hex (0,0,0) which is blocking my settlement at node 2. This is hurting my ore production significantly.

2. If I play the knight card:
   - I can move the robber off my ore hex
   - I can potentially steal one of RED's 5 cards (possibly ore or wheat)
   - I maintain my largest army bonus
   - I delay the dice roll but gain strategic advantage

3. If I roll the dice:
   - The robber stays on my ore hex, continuing to block production
   - I might get unlucky with the roll
   - I get no guaranteed resource (unlike the steal from playing knight)

4. Looking at my plan:
   - I need ore desperately for my city upgrade strategy
   - Unblocking my ore hex is critical for my ore-wheat strategy
   - Getting an additional resource from RED could help my next build

<plan>
1. Play knight card now to unblock my ore hex and possibly steal ore/wheat
2. Roll dice on next turn with improved production potential
3. Continue development card strategy for hidden VP and largest army
4. Upgrade settlement at node 2 to city as soon as resources allow
5. Target path: 3 cities (6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2+ VP cards = 10+ VP
</plan>

Playing the knight card provides an immediate tactical advantage by unblocking my ore hex, which is essential for my city-building strategy. It also gives me a guaranteed resource from RED.

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan - Knight Card Play

I need to determine the optimal hex to place the robber for maximum strategic advantage. Let me analyze the situation carefully.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 5/10 victory points (1 settlement, 1 city, largest army)
- RED has 7/10 victory points (3 settlements, 1 city, longest road)
- I hold 1 wood, 1 wheat, 1 knight card, and 1 victory point card
- My key production: Ore (8), City at high-value wheat/sheep hex (6, 8)
- Currently the robber is on my ore hex (0,0,0) with number 8, crippling my ore production

## Strategic Priorities
1. UNBLOCK my own ore production (critical for city upgrades)
2. BLOCK RED's most valuable resource production
3. STEAL a high-value resource (preferably ore or wheat)

## Analyzing Robber Placement Options
Looking at RED's settlements and cities:
- RED has a city at node 4: produces ore(8), wheat(6), sheep(5)
- RED's best hex is ore(8) - blocking this would significantly slow them down

The most strategic options:
- Option [0]: Move to (1,-1,0) - Blocks RED's ore(12) + steal from RED
- Option [2]: Move to (-1,0,1) - Blocks RED's wheat(6) + steal from RED
- Option [5]: Move to (1,0,-1) - Blocks RED's sheep(8) + steal from RED

Option [2] targets wheat(6) with three probability dots, which is a high-value hex for RED's city. This would significantly impact their ability to build cities (their likely next step with 7 points).

<plan>
1. Move robber to RED's wheat(6) hex to block their city's production
2. Steal a resource from RED (hopefully ore or wheat)
3. Roll dice on my next turn with my ore production unblocked
4. Use resources toward city upgrade at node 2
5. Continue buying development cards for potential victory points and largest army
</plan>

After careful analysis, blocking RED's wheat(6) hex provides the most strategic advantage. This directly impacts their city's production while unblocking my own ore hex. RED is close to winning at 7 points, so disrupting their high-probability wheat production is critical.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 61 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Move robber to RED's wheat(6) hex to block their city's production
2. Steal a resource from RED (hopefully ore or wheat)
3. Roll dice on my next turn with my ore production unblocked
4. Use resources toward city upgrade at node 2
5. Continue buying development cards for potential victory points and largest army
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.
  To adjust your plan, provide a NEW PLAN in your reasoning with <plan>your new plan</plan>

# Analyzing Game State

Let me analyze my current situation:

- **Victory Points**: I have 5 VP (1 settlement + 1 city + largest army + 1 VP card)
- **Resources**: 2 wood, 1 wheat, 1 ore
- **Development Cards**: 1 knight, 1 victory point card
- **Current Plan**: Move robber off my ore hex to RED's wheat hex

## Game Position Analysis
- RED is ahead with 7 VP (3 settlements + 1 city + longest road)
- RED has 5 hidden resource cards - potentially enough for a development card or settlement
- The robber is currently on (-1, 0, 1) which is a wheat hex with value 6 (high probability)
- My ore production at node 2 is currently unblocked
- I need more resources to execute my city upgrade strategy

## Available Actions
1. **[0] Play Knight Card**: Move robber and steal from RED
2. **[1] Roll Dice**: Normal turn progression to collect resources

## Strategic Decision
The robber is currently on a wheat hex that doesn't affect me directly but might be affecting RED's city at node 4. Looking more closely, RED's city at node 4 produces from wheat(6), ore(8), and sheep(5). Since the robber is already on the wheat(6) hex, it's already blocking one of RED's best resources.

If I roll the dice now:
- I might get resources from my settlements (3× ore on an 8-roll would be excellent)
- The robber stays where it is, continuing to block RED's wheat production

If I play the knight:
- I'd move the robber (likely to another of RED's high-value hexes)
- I'd steal one card from RED (could be useful)
- I strengthen my largest army lead (though I already have it secured with 5 knights)

Since my ore production is currently unblocked and I need resources to advance my city strategy, rolling is the better choice. Playing the knight would be more valuable after a good resource roll or if the robber was blocking my key production.

<plan>
1. Roll dice to collect resources
2. Save knight card for when robber is placed on my high-value hexes
3. Continue working toward upgrading settlement at node 2 to a city
4. Buy development cards when possible for VP and knights
5. Maintain largest army advantage
</plan>

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze my current situation in detail:

## Victory Points (5/10)
- 1 VP from settlement
- 2 VP from city
- 2 VP from Largest Army
- 1 VP from hidden Victory Point card
= 5 VP (need 5 more)

## Resources
- 2 Wood, 2 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 2 Ore
- Almost enough for a city upgrade (need 3 Ore, 2 Wheat)

## Options Analysis

### Option 0: Play Knight Card
- Advantages:
  - Can move robber from wheat hex (-1,0,1) where it's currently blocking production
  - Could steal a resource from RED (who has 8 cards)
  - Strengthens my largest army advantage (5→6 knights)
- Disadvantages:
  - I'm only 1 robber roll away from losing resources (I have 7 cards)
  - Knight might be more valuable later when robber is placed on my key production hexes

### Option 1: End Turn
- Advantages:
  - Save knight card for protecting my high-value hexes
- Disadvantages:
  - Waste a turn with no progress
  - Risk losing cards if 7 is rolled next

### Option 2: Buy Development Card
- Advantages:
  - Could get another VP card (bringing me to 6 VP)
  - Could get another knight to further secure largest army
  - Could get monopoly/year of plenty to help with city building
  - Reduces hand size to 4 cards (safe from robber)
- Disadvantages:
  - Uses resources I might need for city upgrade

## Strategic Assessment

The best strategic option is buying a development card:
1. It aligns with the ore-wheat strategy by potentially providing VP or knights
2. It reduces my hand size below 7, protecting from 7 rolls
3. It maintains momentum toward victory
4. RED has 7 VP already - I need to advance my position

<plan>
1. Buy development card to potentially get VP or knight
2. Continue saving resources for city upgrade at node 2
3. Use knight cards strategically to protect high-value hexes
4. Maintain largest army advantage
5. Look for opportunities to get wheat for city upgrade
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis: Turn 61

Let me carefully analyze the current game state and my options to determine the best action.

## Current Game Status
- My VP: 5/10 (1 settlement, 1 city, largest army)
- Red's VP: 7/10 (3 settlements, 1 city, longest road)
- Red is ahead by 2 VP

## My Resources
- 2 Wood, 1 Sheep, 1 Ore
- Not enough for any significant build

## My Development Cards
- 1 Knight
- 1 Monopoly
- 1 Victory Point (hidden from opponent)

## Strategic Assessment
Red is at 7 VP and could be close to winning. My goal is to reach 10 VP through:
- Current: 5 VP (1 settlement = 1VP, 1 city = 2VP, largest army = 2VP)
- Hidden VP card: +1 VP
- Path to remaining 4 VP: Upgrade settlement to city (+1 VP), build 1 more settlement (+1 VP), and use development cards for additional VP or build another city

The robber is currently on a wheat hex (-1,0,1) with dice number 6, which is a high-probability hex. This is hampering wheat production that could help with city upgrades.

## Action Options
1. **Play Knight Card**: Move the robber and steal a resource from Red
2. **End Turn**: Keep my current resources

## Decision Logic
Playing the Knight card offers several advantages:
- Move the robber from a wheat-producing hex to a hex that affects Red's production
- Steal a resource from Red (potentially wheat or ore)
- Reinforce my largest army advantage

Since I don't have enough resources to build anything significant this turn, and the robber is currently on a valuable hex, playing the Knight card is the optimal move.

<plan>
1. Play Knight and move robber to a high-value ore or wheat hex that Red is collecting from
2. Continue saving resources for city upgrade at node 2
3. Look for opportunities to get wheat for city upgrade
4. Consider using Monopoly card when probability favors ore or wheat collection
5. Track Red's progress carefully - they're 3 VP ahead if I count my hidden VP

# Game Analysis for Optimal Robber Placement

I need to decide where to move the robber as a crucial defensive and offensive play. Let me analyze this systematically.

## Current Game State Assessment:
- I have 5 visible VP plus 1 hidden VP card = 6 VP total
- Red has 7 VP (with Longest Road)
- Red is ahead by 1 VP, so I must slow them down
- I'm executing an ore-wheat focused strategy
- I need more resources for my next city upgrade at node 2

## Robber Placement Considerations:
1. Target high-probability tiles that Red is collecting from
2. Prioritize ore and wheat hexes (most valuable for city builds)
3. Maximize impact by targeting hexes that affect multiple Red buildings
4. Steal opportunity is important - I should target Red when possible

## Option Analysis:

Looking at Red's buildings:
- Node 4: produces ⛏️8[⭐⭐⭐], 🌾6[⭐⭐⭐], 🐑5[⭐⭐] - VERY high value
- Node 23: produces 🐑8[⭐⭐⭐], 🧱3[⭐], 🌲4[⭐]
- Node 17: produces 🐑5[⭐⭐], ⛏️5[⭐⭐], 🧱4[⭐]
- Node 7: produces ⛏️12, 🌲9[⭐⭐], 🌲4[⭐]

The most impactful options:
- Option [0]: Hex (0,0,0) - Red's ⛏️8 hex (high-value ore with 3 pips) also affects my node 2
- Option [3]: Hex (-1,1,0) - Red's 🐑5 hex affecting node 4 and 17
- Option [5]: Hex (1,0,-1) - Red's 🐑8 hex affecting node 23
- Option [0] would block my own ore income too, which is suboptimal

Looking at high-value wheat:
- Option [4]: Hex (0,1,-1) - 🌾11 wheat hex - but this doesn't affect Red directly
- Option [15]: Hex (1,1,-2) - 🌾6 wheat hex with 3 pips, affecting Red's node 49
- Option [14]: Hex (0,2,-2) - 🌲3 wood hex - low value target

The most strategic choice appears to be blocking Red's high-probability resources while also stealing from them. Red has two city-capable resources (ore and wheat) at node 4, so targeting that node's production is optimal.

The best option is [3] which blocks Red's sheep on hex (-1,1,0) that affects their settlement at node 17 AND city at node 4. This disrupts their resource diversity and lets me steal from them.

<plan>
1. Move robber to (-1,1,0) and steal from Red to block their sheep production
2. Continue saving resources for city upgrade at node 2
3. Look for opportunities to get wheat for city upgrade
4. Consider using Monopoly card when probability favors ore or wheat collection
5. Track Red's progress carefully - they're 1 VP ahead of my total 6 VP (including hidden)
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 63 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Move robber to (-1,1,0) and steal from Red to block their sheep production
2. Continue saving resources for city upgrade at node 2
3. Look for opportunities to get wheat for city upgrade
4. Consider using Monopoly card when probability favors ore or wheat collection
5. Track Red's progress carefully - they're 1 VP ahead of my total 6 VP (including hidden)

# Game State Analysis

I'll analyze the current situation and determine the best action:

## Current Status
- I have 6 VP total (1 settlement + 1 city + 2 for largest army + 1 hidden VP card)
- Red has 7 VP (3 settlements + 1 city + 2 for longest road)
- Resources: 3 wood, 1 sheep
- Development cards: 1 Monopoly, 1 Victory Point card
- My city strategy focuses on ore and wheat for upgrades

## Monopoly Card Evaluation
The Monopoly card lets me take all of one resource from other players:

1. WOOD - We already have 3 wood, which isn't our priority resource
2. BRICK - Useful for roads but not critical for city strategy
3. SHEEP - Useful for development cards but not immediate priority
4. WHEAT - Critical resource for city upgrades and development cards
5. ORE - Critical resource for city upgrades

Red has 3 hidden cards. If I could know what those are, I could make a better choice.

## Strategic Considerations
- I need ore and wheat to progress my city strategy
- Red's settlement at node 4 produces both high-value ore and wheat
- Looking at buildings, Red has access to ore (from nodes 4 and 7) and wheat (from node 4)
- Playing Monopoly now before rolling is strategic since Red may have ore or wheat

<plan>
1. Play Monopoly for wheat or ore (whichever has higher chance of gain)
2. Roll dice and gather resources
3. Save resources for city upgrade at node 2
4. Move robber to hex (-1,1,0) if 7 is rolled to block Red's sheep production
5. Continue city-focused strategy to catch up to Red's VP lead
</plan>

## Decision
Based on Red's building placements, they have strong production of both ore and wheat from their city at node 4. Given the ore-wheat strategy and Red's access to ore from two settlements, I believe there's a higher chance Red is holding ore among their 3 cards.

Therefore, I'll play the Monopoly card targeting ore.

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 69 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Play Monopoly for wheat or ore (whichever has higher chance of gain)
2. Roll dice and gather resources
3. Save resources for city upgrade at node 2
4. Move robber to hex (-1,1,0) if 7 is rolled to block Red's sheep production
5. Continue city-focused strategy to catch up to Red's VP lead
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis and Action Selection

Let me analyze the current game state to determine the optimal action:

## Game Status
- I have 5/10 victory points (1 settlement, 1 city, 2 VP from Largest Army, 1 VP card)
- Red has 7/10 victory points (3 settlements, 1 city, 2 VP from Longest Road)
- Red is leading by 2 VP and has 8 hidden resource cards
- The robber is on wheat hex (0,1,-1), which is blocking production from my city at node 20

## My Resources
- 1 Wood, 3 Sheep, 4 Wheat, 1 Ore
- I need 3 ore and 2 wheat for a city upgrade
- I need 1 brick and 1 wood for a new settlement

## Evaluating Options
1. **End Turn [0]**: Not optimal as I can make a productive move
2. **Buy Development Card [1]**: Costs 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore (I have these)
   - Could draw a VP card (bringing me to 6 VP)
   - Could draw a Knight to strengthen Largest Army lead
   - Could draw Road Building, Year of Plenty, or Monopoly (all useful)
3. **Maritime Trade [2-5]**: 4:1 trades are very inefficient, especially for wheat which is valuable for my city-building strategy

## Strategic Analysis
- I'm 2 ore short of upgrading my settlement at node 2 to a city
- Development cards offer potential VP, knights for defense, or special cards
- With 15 development cards remaining, there's a decent chance of drawing something useful
- The ore-wheat strategy prioritizes city development, and I currently lack sufficient ore

<plan>
1. Buy a development card to increase chances of victory
2. If it's a VP card, I'll be at 6 points
3. If it's Year of Plenty or Monopoly, I can use it to get ore for city upgrade
4. If it's a Knight, I can move the robber off my wheat production
5. Next turn focus on gathering more ore for city upgrade at node 2
</plan>

Given my ore-wheat strategy and current shortage of ore for city building, buying a development card is the best move. It maintains flexibility while potentially providing victory points or useful cards to advance my city-building strategy.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)

- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes

# Game Analysis: Settlers of Catan Turn 71

Let me analyze the current state of the game and determine the optimal action:

## Current Game Status
- I have 5 victory points: 1 settlement (1 VP) + 1 city (2 VP) + Largest Army (2 VP)
- I have 1 hidden Victory Point card, bringing my actual total to 6 VP
- I need 4 more points to win

## Resource Analysis
- Current resources: 1 Wood, 2 Sheep, 3 Wheat
- No Ore (needed for city upgrades or development cards)
- No Brick (needed for roads/settlements)
- The robber is on a Wheat hex (0, 1, -1) with value 11 - but not one that affects me

## Development Cards
- I have 1 Knight card available to play
- Playing knights helps maintain my Largest Army advantage

## Strategic Considerations
1. I need to either collect resources to build/upgrade, or use my Knight to steal a resource
2. If I roll first, I could get more resources but risk losing cards to a 7
3. If I play my Knight first, I can move the robber and potentially steal the Ore I need

<plan>
1. Play Knight card to move robber to Red's Ore hex (0, 0, 0) with value 8
2. Try to steal Ore from Red who has 6 cards
3. Roll the dice after playing Knight
4. Continue saving resources for a city upgrade at node 2
5. If I get enough Ore, prioritize city upgrade; if not, consider buying another development card
</plan>

My current priority is to gather Ore for city upgrades. Playing the Knight card now gives me a chance to steal an Ore from Red (who has 6 cards) and also move the robber to block Red's best Ore production. This is superior to rolling first, which could result in a 7 and losing resources.

Therefore, I choose to:

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 71 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Play Knight card to move robber to Red's Ore hex (0, 0, 0) with value 8
2. Try to steal Ore from Red who has 6 cards
3. Roll the dice after playing Knight
4. Continue saving resources for a city upgrade at node 2
5. If I get enough Ore, prioritize city upgrade; if not, consider buying another development card

# Game Analysis: Robber Placement Decision

I need to decide where to move the robber to maximize my chances of winning by executing my ore-wheat strategy. I'll analyze the game state thoroughly before making my decision.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 5 VP: 1 settlement (1 VP), 1 city (2 VP), largest army (2 VP)
- Red has 7 VP: 3 settlements (3 VP), 1 city (2 VP), longest road (2 VP)
- I'm behind by 2 VP, so every move is critical
- I have 1 wood, 2 sheep, 3 wheat, and a victory point card
- I need ore to build a city at node 2 (which would be excellent)

## Robber Strategy Options
The optimal robber placement should:
1. Block a high-probability resource that Red needs
2. Preferably block ore or wheat production (best resources)
3. Maximize the chance of stealing a valuable resource from Red

Looking at Red's production:
- Red has a city at node 4 producing ore (8), wheat (6), and sheep (5)
- This is Red's most valuable production node

## Best Robber Placements:

Option [0]: Move robber to (0, 0, 0) - Ore hex with value 8
- This blocks an 8-value ore hex
- Red's city at node 4 produces from this hex
- This is extremely valuable for the ore-wheat strategy
- This would block ore from both Red AND myself (node 2)
- While this hurts me too, Red has a city here so it hurts them more

Option [3]: Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) - Wheat hex with value 6
- This blocks a 6-value wheat hex
- Red's city at node 4 produces from this hex
- This is also valuable for the ore-wheat strategy

## Decision Process:
Although blocking the ore (8) would hurt my own production at node 2, it hurts Red more since they have a city producing from it. The wheat (6) is also important, but ore is typically harder to get and more critical for city upgrades.

Red has 6 hidden cards - there's a good chance they have some ore that I could steal, which would directly help me upgrade to a city.

<plan>
1. Place robber on Red's Ore hex (0,0,0) with value 8 to block production from Red's city
2. Try to steal Ore from Red who has 6 cards
3. Continue saving resources for city upgrade at node 2
4. Buy development cards if I can't get enough ore
5. Try to establish a third settlement to reach toward potential longest road
</plan>

Based on my analysis, I'll place the robber on Red's 8-value ore hex, stealing a card from Red.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 71 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Place robber on Red's Ore hex (0,0,0) with value 8 to block production from Red's city
2. Try to steal Ore from Red who has 6 cards
3. Continue saving resources for city upgrade at node 2
4. Buy development cards if I can't get enough ore
5. Try to establish a third settlement to reach toward potential longest road
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze my current game state:

**Victory Points (5/10):**
- 1 Settlement (1 VP)
- 1 City (2 VP)
- Largest Army (2 VP)
- 1 VP Development Card (hidden)

**Resources:**
- 1 Wood
- 3 Sheep
- 5 Wheat
- 0 Brick
- 0 Ore

**Current Plan Analysis:**
1. The robber is already on Red's Ore hex (0,0,0) with value 8
2. I need more Ore for city upgrades or development cards
3. I have 5 Wheat, which is enough for a development card if I can get 1 Ore
4. I need more resources for strategic advancement

## Resource Evaluation

For my ore-wheat strategy, I'm critically short on ore. I have plenty of wheat (5), but no ore to build cities or development cards, which are my primary focus. I could trade 4 wheat for 1 ore using maritime trade.

## Available Actions Assessment

[0] End turn - Not optimal as I can make a productive move
[1] Trade 4 wheat for 1 brick - Not useful for my strategy
[2] Trade 4 wheat for 1 ore - Helps me buy a development card
[3] Trade 4 wheat for 1 sheep - Not needed (already have 3 sheep)
[4] Trade 4 wheat for 1 wood - Not needed (already have 1 wood)

## Decision Logic

Given my ore-wheat strategy:
- I need ore for development cards or city upgrades
- With 1 ore (from trading), I could buy a development card (1 ore + 1 wheat + 1 sheep)
- Development cards could give me:
  * Victory points (directly advancing my win condition)
  * Knights (strengthening largest army advantage)
  * Year of Plenty or Monopoly (resource acquisition)

<plan>
1. Trade 4 wheat for 1 ore
2. Use the ore + 1 wheat + 1 sheep to buy a development card
3. Next turn, assess resources and consider trading for ore again
4. Continue focus on upgrading settlement at node 2 to a city when possible
5. Plan for expanding with new settlement toward longest road
</plan>

The most effective action is to trade for ore so I can buy a development card:

- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

❓ Select action by number (0-1):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state to determine the best action for the ore-wheat strategy:

## Game State Assessment:
- I have 5/10 VPs (1 settlement, 1 city, largest army, 1 VP card)
- Resources: 1 wood, 3 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore
- RED has 7/10 VPs and longest road bonus
- I have exactly the right resources to buy a development card (1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore)
- The robber is on the ore hex with value 8, currently blocking one of my key ore production spots

## Strategic Options:
1. **Buy a development card (Option 1)**:
   - Could draw a VP card (bringing me to 6/10 VPs)
   - Could draw a Knight to strengthen my largest army lead
   - Could draw a useful action card (Year of Plenty, Monopoly, Road Building)
   - Uses my current ore which is crucial but currently limited

2. **End turn (Option 0)**:
   - Save resources for potentially upgrading my settlement at node 2 to a city
   - But I would need 3 ore + 2 wheat total (I'm far from this currently)
   - Risk losing cards to a 7 roll if I accumulate too many

## Decision Analysis:
- RED is at 7 VP and could be close to winning
- I need to make progress toward 10 VP
- Converting my settlement at node 2 to a city should be a priority, but I don't have enough resources
- My ore production is poor due to the robber position
- Development cards offer immediate progress and potential VPs or helpful actions

<plan>
1. Buy a development card now
2. If it's a VP card, I'll reach 6/10 VP
3. If it's a Knight, I'll strengthen my largest army lead and can move the robber off my ore hex
4. Next turns: focus on getting ore + wheat to upgrade my settlement at node 2 to a city
5. Long-term: aim for one more settlement to reach 9 VP, then either another VP card or one more city
</plan>

The optimal action is to buy a development card. This advances my position immediately and gives me tactical options while maintaining my ore-wheat strategy.

# Turn Analysis: BLUE Player at Turn 73

I need to carefully consider my options to maximize my progress toward victory.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 5/10 Victory Points (1 settlement + 1 city + 2 VP from Largest Army + 1 hidden VP card)
- I have only 2 sheep resources
- I have 1 knight card and 1 VP card in hand
- The robber is on a wheat hex (0,1,-1) with value 11, blocking potential wheat income
- RED has 7 VP (3 settlements + 1 city + 2 VP from Longest Road)

## Options Analysis

### Option 0: Play Knight Card
- Advantages:
  - Can move the robber off the wheat hex (0,1,-1) that's blocking my potential wheat production
  - Could place the robber on RED's high-value hexes (ore 8 or wheat 6)
  - Will steal a resource from RED (who has 5 cards)
  - Further solidifies my Largest Army bonus (going from 7 to 8 knights)
- Disadvantages:
  - I could save the knight for a future turn when I might need it more strategically

### Option 1: Roll the Dice
- Advantages:
  - I might get resources I need for my next build
  - I can always play the knight after rolling if needed
- Disadvantages:
  - If I roll a 7, I won't be able to play the knight afterward on this turn
  - There's a risk of no useful resources on the roll

## Strategic Decision
Given I have very few resources (just 2 sheep), rolling first makes the most sense. I should try to collect resources before taking other actions. The knight can still be played after rolling if needed, unless I roll a 7.

<plan>
1. Roll the dice to try gaining resources
2. If I get useful resources (especially ore/wheat), consider my build options
3. If I get a poor roll or if RED is benefitting too much, play the knight to move the robber
4. Continue focusing on upgrading my settlement at node 2 to a city
5. Look for opportunities to build another settlement to reach 7 visible VP
6. With my hidden VP card, I'll be at 8 VP and need just one more city or two more settlements
</plan>

The best course of action is to roll first, keeping my options open.

- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 73 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Roll the dice to try gaining resources
2. If I get useful resources (especially ore/wheat), consider my build options
3. If I get a poor roll or if RED is benefitting too much, play the knight to move the robber
4. Continue focusing on upgrading my settlement at node 2 to a city
5. Look for opportunities to build another settlement to reach 7 visible VP
6. With my hidden VP card, I'll be at 8 VP and need just one more city or two more settlements
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Strategic Analysis for Turn 73

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 5 visible VP: 1 settlement (1 VP) + 1 city (2 VP) + Largest Army (2 VP)
- I have 1 hidden VP card, bringing my real total to 6 VP
- My resources: 4 🐑 SHEEP, 1 ⛏️ ORE
- I have 1 KNIGHT development card available to play
- RED has 7 VP and 8 hidden resource cards

## Resource Production Analysis
- My settlement at node 2 produces ⛏️8[⭐⭐⭐], ⛏️12, 🌲2 - this is ore-focused but on low probabilities
- My city at node 20 doubles production for 🌾11[⭐], 🐑8[⭐⭐⭐], 🌾6[⭐⭐⭐] - excellent wheat and sheep

## Decision Considerations
1. I don't have enough resources for any builds this turn
2. I have 4 sheep, which I can trade at a 4:1 ratio, but this is inefficient
3. The robber is currently on a wheat hex (0, 1, -1) with a roll of 11, blocking one of my wheat hexes
4. I have a knight card that could move the robber and potentially steal a useful resource from RED

## Option Analysis
- Playing the knight would:
  1. Move the robber away from my wheat hex
  2. Allow me to steal from RED who has 8 cards (good chance of getting something useful)
  3. Further secure my largest army advantage
- Trading 4 sheep for another resource is inefficient (4:1 ratio), especially when I could just play the knight

<plan>
1. Play my knight card to remove the robber from my wheat hex
2. Place the robber on RED's high-value hex (preferably ore-8 at node 4)
3. Steal a resource from RED
4. On future turns, continue focusing on upgrading my settlement at node 2 to a city
5. Look for opportunities to build another settlement to reach 8 visible VP
6. With my hidden VP card, I'll be at 9 VP and need just one more settlement or VP card to win
</plan>

The clear best choice is to play my knight card. This will allow me to:
- Unblock my wheat production
- Potentially steal a valuable resource from RED
- Continue strengthening my largest army advantage

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements

# Game Analysis - Robber Placement Decision

I need to strategically place the robber to maximize my advantage while hindering my opponent's progress.

## Current Game State Assessment:
- I have 5 visible VP (1 settlement, 1 city, Largest Army)
- I have 1 hidden VP card, so actually at 6/10 VP
- RED has 7 VP (3 settlements, 1 city, Longest Road)
- RED is ahead by 1 visible VP and potentially more with their hidden development card

## Robber Placement Options Analysis:

Looking at RED's buildings:
- RED has a city at node 4 producing from ⛏️8, 🌾6, 🐑5
- RED has settlements at nodes 23, 17, and 7

The best targets are the high-value production hexes:
1. Option [0]: Move to ⛏️8 (0,0,0) - Blocks RED's city at node 4 (highest value hex)
2. Option [5]: Move to 🐑8 (1,0,-1) - Blocks RED's settlement at node 23
3. Option [3]: Move to 🌾6 (-1,0,1) - Blocks RED's city at node 4

Option [0] is clearly the best because:
- It blocks RED's city from its most valuable resource (ore)
- Ore is critical for the ORE-WHEAT strategy
- The 8 value has high probability (⭐⭐⭐)
- It directly hurts RED's ability to build more cities
- It also affects my settlement at node 2, but the tradeoff is worth it to block RED

<plan>
1. Place the robber on RED's ore-8 hex to block their city production
2. Steal a resource from RED (hopefully ore or wheat)
3. On future turns, focus on getting enough ore/wheat to upgrade settlement at node 2
4. Use my sheep to buy development cards for potential VP cards
5. Target building one more settlement to reach 8-9 VP
6. Watch for winning opportunity when I can reach 10 VP in one turn

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze my current game position and available options:

## Game State Assessment
- I (BLUE) have 5 VP: 1 settlement (1 VP) + 1 city (2 VP) + Largest Army (2 VP) + 1 hidden VP card
- RED has 7 VP: 3 settlements (3 VP) + 1 city (2 VP) + Longest Road (2 VP)
- Resources: 4 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore
- The robber is located at (0,0,0) which is blocking my settlement at node 2 with an ore-8 hex

## Available Actions
1. End turn
2. Buy a development card (1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore)
3-5. Various maritime trades with my sheep

## Strategic Considerations
- I need 5 more VP to win
- I have good ore/wheat production when the robber isn't on my hex
- Development cards could provide VP or knights to maintain my largest army advantage
- My sheep surplus is not that useful on its own

## Analysis of Options
Looking at option 1 (end turn): This wastes my resources and makes no progress.

Looking at option 2 (buy development card): This would use all my current resources, but:
- Could draw a VP card (25% chance in remaining deck)
- Could get a knight to further secure Largest Army
- Could get a special card (Road Building, Year of Plenty, Monopoly)
- Keeps me under 7 cards in case of a 7 roll
- Aligns with my ore-wheat strategy by potentially converting sheep into more useful resources

Options 3-5 (maritime trades): These are inefficient 4:1 trades since I don't have access to a sheep port. Trading away sheep doesn't help me advance toward my city-building goal right now.

<plan>
1. Buy a development card to potentially get a VP card or knight
2. Next turn, focus on moving the robber off my ore-8 hex
3. Continue accumulating ore/wheat to upgrade settlement at node 2
4. Look for opportunities to build one more settlement to secure additional resources
5. Keep track of RED's progress and block when necessary with the robber
6. Win by reaching 10 VP with cities, settlements, largest army, and VP cards
</plan>

Based on my analysis, I should buy a development card as it gives me the best chance of progressing toward victory by potentially gaining a VP card or strengthening my largest army advantage.

- I have 5 VP: 1 settlement (1 VP), 1 city (2 VP), largest army (2 VP)
- I have 2 hidden VP development cards, so my actual total is 7 VP
- RED has 8 VP: 2 settlements (2 VP), 2 cities (4 VP), longest road (2 VP)
- I need 3 more VP to win

## Resource Assessment
- I have 4 sheep, 2 wheat, 1 ore
- I need more ore to build a city (5 ore + 2 wheat)
- The robber is on a wheat hex (0,1,-1), but not affecting my production

## Strategic Options
1. Buy development card (1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore) - This would use my only ore, but could give me a VP card, knight, or useful action card
2. Trade sheep for resources - Not efficient with 4:1 ratio since I don't have sheep port access
3. End turn and accumulate more resources - Conservative option

## Decision Analysis

Buying a development card has several advantages:
- Potential to draw a VP card - there are likely 3 VP cards remaining (5 total minus my 2)
- Potential to draw a knight to strengthen largest army bonus
- Reduces hand size to avoid resource loss if a 7 is rolled
- Investing in development cards aligns with my ore-wheat strategy since ore production is currently limited

Trading sheep is inefficient at 4:1 ratio and won't give me enough for any meaningful build.

Ending my turn without action seems wasteful when I have resources for a development card purchase.

<plan>
1. Buy a development card now to potentially increase VP or get a useful card
2. Continue accumulating ore/wheat for city upgrade at settlement node 2
3. If the development card is a knight, save it to defend my key hexes from the robber
4. If it's a VP card, I'll be at 8 VP (just 2 away from winning)
5. Focus on maximizing ore and wheat production for my next city
</plan>

Based on the analysis, buying a development card is the optimal move as it advances my strategy while using resources efficiently.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 83 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Buy a development card now to potentially increase VP or get a useful card
2. Continue accumulating ore/wheat for city upgrade at settlement node 2
3. If the development card is a knight, save it to defend my key hexes from the robber
4. If it's a VP card, I'll be at 8 VP (just 2 away from winning)
5. Focus on maximizing ore and wheat production for my next city

# Analysis of Game State and Available Actions

## Current Game Status
- I have 5 victory points: 1 settlement (1 VP), 1 city (2 VP), Largest Army (2 VP)
- I have 3 hidden Victory Point development cards, so my actual VP is 8/10
- RED has 9 VP and is just 1 point away from winning
- I have 4 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore - enough to buy a development card

## Resource Production Analysis
- My city at node 20 produces wheat (11, 6) and sheep (8) - strong wheat production
- My settlement at node 2 produces ore (8, 12) - decent ore production
- I'm weak on wood and brick, which limits my ability to expand with roads and settlements

## Strategic Options

**Option 1: Buy Development Card (Action 1)**
- Resources required: 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore (have all these)
- Possible outcomes:
  * Knight: Would strengthen my Largest Army position (already have 8 knights)
  * Victory Point: Would put me at 9/10 VP, just 1 away from winning
  * Year of Plenty/Monopoly/Road Building: Could help with future turns

**Option 2: Maritime Trade (Actions 2-5)**
- Trading 4 sheep for any resource is inefficient
- Since I have 4 sheep, I could trade for a resource I need, but:
  * I already have wheat and ore for a development card
  * Wood/brick would only be useful for expansion, which isn't my priority now

**Option 3: End Turn (Action 0)**
- Allows me to collect more resources next turn
- Risky as RED is at 9 VP and might win on their next turn

## Decision Logic

1. RED has 9 VP and is likely to win on their next turn
2. I have 8 VP (including my 3 hidden VP cards)
3. My best chance to win is to get to 10 VP as quickly as possible
4. Buying a development card gives me a chance at another VP card or knight
5. If I get a VP card, I'll have 9 VP and need just 1 more
6. If I get a knight, I'll strengthen my Largest Army position
7. Trading sheep is inefficient compared to buying a development card

<plan>
1. Buy a development card now - potentially getting a VP card (bringing me to 9 VP)
2. If I get a knight or other utility card, save it for critical moments
3. Next turn, focus on upgrading my settlement at node 2 to a city (need 2 more ore, 1 more wheat)
4. If I get a VP card now, I'll need just 1 more VP to win - could come from another development card
</plan>

Given RED's 9 VP status, I need to take immediate action. Buying a development card is my best option as it could potentially give me another Victory Point card or a knight to protect my key resources.

# Game Analysis

Let me carefully analyze the game state and decide between my two options:

## Current Game Status
- I (BLUE) have 5 visible VP: 1 settlement (1 VP), 1 city (2 VP), and Largest Army (2 VP)
- I also have 3 hidden Victory Point cards, bringing my actual total to 8 VP
- RED has 9 VP and is close to winning
- I need 2 more VP to win (since I already have 8 VP total)

## Resources & Building Options
- I currently have 5 sheep and 1 ore
- To upgrade my settlement at node 2 to a city, I need 3 ore and 2 wheat (so I need 2 more ore and 2 wheat)
- I don't have the resources to build anything immediately

## My Options
**Option 0: Play Knight**
- I would move the robber and steal a resource from RED
- This doesn't immediately progress my win condition
- I already have Largest Army, so playing another knight provides no VP benefit
- The stolen resource is unlikely to complete a city build (I need multiple resources)

**Option 1: Roll the dice**
- This gives me a chance to gain resources based on my settlements/cities
- My settlement at node 2 produces on 8, 12, and 2
- My city at node 20 produces on 11, 8, and 6 (and gives double resources)
- Rolling could potentially give me what I need to buy a development card

## Strategic Considerations
- With 8 total VP, I only need 2 more VP to win
- There are 9 development cards remaining in the bank
- Each dev card purchase gives me a chance at another VP card
- My current plan focuses on buying development cards to find the remaining VP cards I need

<plan>
1. Roll the dice to gain resources
2. Use resources to buy a development card - looking for VP card #4
3. If I get a VP card, I'll be at 9 VP and need just one more VP
4. Save for city upgrade at node 2 only if I can't buy development cards
5. Keep buying development cards until I find my 5th VP card
</plan>

The clear strategic choice is to roll the dice and try to gain resources that will let me buy a development card.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 85 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Roll the dice to gain resources
2. Use resources to buy a development card - looking for VP card #4
3. If I get a VP card, I'll be at 9 VP and need just one more VP
4. Save for city upgrade at node 2 only if I can't buy development cards
5. Keep buying development cards until I find my 5th VP card
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis for Blue Player (Turn 85)

Let me carefully analyze the current game state, my resources, and strategic options.

## Current Game State
- I (Blue) have 5 VP: 1 settlement (1 VP) + 1 city (2 VP) + Largest Army (2 VP)
- I also have 3 hidden VP cards, bringing my actual total to 8 VP
- Red has 9 VP (visible): 3 settlements (3 VP) + 2 cities (4 VP) + Longest Road (2 VP)
- Red only needs 1 more VP to win
- I need 2 more VP to win (and I can potentially get it with one more VP development card)

## My Resources
- 1 🌲WOOD, 5 🐑SHEEP, 1 ⛏️ORE
- Not enough for a city (3 ore, 2 wheat)
- Not enough for a settlement (1 brick, 1 wood, 1 wheat, 1 sheep)
- Almost enough for a development card (1 ore, 1 wheat, 1 sheep) - missing wheat

## Strategic Assessment
1. Red is ahead and one VP away from winning
2. I have 8 actual VP with my hidden VP cards
3. I need to get to 10 VP before Red gets their 10th point
4. Given my resources, my best option is to trade for wheat and then buy a development card
5. There's a chance (though small) of drawing my 4th VP card, which would give me the win

<plan>
1. Trade 4 sheep for 1 wheat at the general port
2. Use 1 wheat + 1 ore + 1 sheep to buy a development card
3. Hope for a VP card to reach 9 VP total
4. Continue seeking one more VP through another development card or settlement
</plan>

## Decision Analysis
- Option [0] Play Knight: Not strategically useful now; I already have Largest Army
- Option [1] End Turn: Would waste my sheep resources and miss opportunity to progress
- Options [2-5] Maritime Trade: Option [2] is the best - trading for wheat which I need for a development card

Since my priority is to buy a development card hoping for a VP card, and I need wheat for this purchase, I'll trade 4 sheep for 1 wheat.

# Game Analysis: Settlers of Catan

I need to carefully analyze my position and make the optimal move to advance my ore-wheat strategy.

## Current Position Assessment
- I have 5 VP total (1 settlement, 1 city, Largest Army)
- I also have 3 hidden VP cards = 3 more points
- This means I'm actually at 8 VP out of 10 needed to win
- I have 1 wood, 1 sheep, 1 wheat, and 1 ore
- RED has 9 VP and is very close to winning

## Available Actions
0. Play Knight card
1. End turn
2. Buy a development card (1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore)

## Strategic Options Analysis

### Option 0: Play Knight Card
- I could use the knight to disrupt RED's resource production
- However, I already have Largest Army with 8 knights played
- Playing another knight gives me no immediate benefit

### Option 1: End Turn
- This would waste my current resources and opportunity to progress

### Option 2: Buy a Development Card
- This costs my sheep, wheat, and ore
- There are 9 development cards left in the deck
- The deck typically contains 14 knights, 5 VP cards, 2 Monopoly, 2 Road Building, 2 Year of Plenty
- I've seen 8 knights played, 2 Monopoly, 1 Road Building, and 3 VP cards
- So the remaining deck could have ~6 knights, ~2 VP cards, ~0-1 Road Building, ~2 Year of Plenty
- **If I draw a VP card, I'll have 9 VP and be one away from winning**

<plan>
1. Buy a development card hoping for a VP card to reach 9 VP
2. If I get a VP, I'll be at 9 VP (just 1 away from victory)
3. If I get a knight, I can play it to protect resources
4. Next turn, try to get resources for another development card for potential final VP
</plan>

Since RED has 9 VP, I must make progress toward victory. Buying a development card is my best chance to get closer to winning, especially since I might draw a VP card. Even if I don't, other cards like knights will help me maintain control.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 85 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Buy a development card hoping for a VP card to reach 9 VP
2. If I get a VP, I'll be at 9 VP (just 1 away from victory)
3. If I get a knight, I can play it to protect resources
4. Next turn, try to get resources for another development card for potential final VP
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me think through the current game state and my options carefully.

## Current Situation
- I'm BLUE with 5 victory points visible (1 settlement, 1 city, largest army)
- I have 3 hidden VP cards, which means my actual VP count is 8
- RED has 9 visible VP (3 settlements, 2 cities, longest road)
- I have limited resources: just 1 wood
- I have 2 knight cards I could play

## Victory Point Assessment
- My actual VP: 5 visible + 3 hidden VP cards = 8 VP
- RED's VP: 9 visible VP (they're just 1 point away from winning)
- RED is dangerously close to winning on their next turn

## Available Actions
- [0] Play Knight card - Move the robber and steal a resource
- [1] End turn

## Strategic Considerations:
1. RED is just 1 VP away from winning and has 5 hidden cards. They could potentially win on their next turn.
2. I don't have enough resources to build anything - just 1 wood.
3. Playing a knight would let me steal a resource from RED, which could help me and potentially disrupt their win.
4. If I play a knight, I could move the robber to one of RED's productive hexes (like the 8 ore or 6 wheat).

<plan>
1. Play the knight to move the robber to a high-value hex for RED
2. Target their 8 ore hex or 6 wheat hex to disrupt their resource generation
3. Steal a resource which could help me toward building something next turn
4. Next turn, try to either build something or buy another development card
</plan>

Given the situation, playing a knight is strategic because:
- It allows me to steal a resource I desperately need
- It lets me block a high-value hex from RED
- It could potentially disrupt RED's plans to win next turn
- I get no benefit from ending my turn with just 1 wood

Therefore, I should play the knight card.

# Robber Placement Analysis

Let me think through the best placement for the robber strategically:

## Current Game State Assessment
- RED is at 9 VP (very close to winning)
- I'm at 5 VP with 3 victory point cards hidden, so I'm actually at 8 VP
- RED has the longest road bonus (2 VP)
- I have the largest army bonus (2 VP)
- RED has 5 hidden resources
- I have only 1 wood resource

## Important RED Production
Looking at RED's settlements and cities:
- RED's city at node 4: ⛏️8[⭐⭐⭐], 🌾6[⭐⭐⭐], 🐑5[⭐⭐] → High-value ore and wheat production
- RED's city at node 17: 🐑5[⭐⭐], ⛏️5[⭐⭐], 🧱4[⭐] → Secondary ore production 
- RED's settlement at node 16: 🐑5[⭐⭐], 🌾11[⭐], 🌾9[⭐⭐] → Wheat production
- RED's settlement at node 23: 🐑8[⭐⭐⭐], 🧱3[⭐], 🌲4[⭐] → High-value sheep
- RED's settlement at node 7: ⛏️12, 🌲9[⭐⭐], 🌲4[⭐] → Wood production

## Robber Placement Options
The best targets would hit RED's most productive hexes:
1. Target hex (0, 0, 0) → ⛏️8[⭐⭐⭐] (Action 0) - This hits their high-value ore city
2. Target hex (-1, 0, 1) → 🌾6[⭐⭐⭐] (Action 3) - This hits their high-value wheat city
3. Target hex (1, 0, -1) → 🐑8[⭐⭐⭐] (Action 6) - This hits their high-value sheep settlement

## Strategic Decision
Since RED is one point away from winning, and the ore-wheat strategy focuses on disrupting ore/wheat resources, I should target either their best ore or wheat hex. Between these two:

- Hex (0, 0, 0) with ore 8 is extremely valuable and is used by RED's city at node 4
- Hex (-1, 0, 1) with wheat 6 is also very valuable and used by the same city

Since ore is typically harder to get and more critical for city building, disrupting the ore 8 hex would be most devastating to RED's strategy.

<plan>
1. Place robber on RED's ore 8 hex to block their most valuable ore production
2. Steal a resource from RED, hoping for ore or wheat
3. Next turn, evaluate playing another development card or building something if I get useful resources from my robber steal
4. Continue focusing on disrupting RED's ore/wheat production while working toward my final 2 VP needed to win
</plan>

Therefore, I will select action [0] to move the robber to the (0, 0, 0) hex with ore 8 and steal from RED.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 87 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Place robber on RED's ore 8 hex to block their most valuable ore production
2. Steal a resource from RED, hoping for ore or wheat
3. Next turn, evaluate playing another development card or building something if I get useful resources from my robber steal
4. Continue focusing on disrupting RED's ore/wheat production while working toward my final 2 VP needed to win

# Game Analysis

Let me evaluate my current situation and available actions:

## Victory Points Breakdown
- I currently have 5 VPs:
  - 1 Settlement (1 VP)
  - 1 City (2 VP)
  - Largest Army (2 VP)
  - 3 Victory Point cards (hidden, worth 3 VP)

This means I actually have 8 VP total, with 3 hidden! I only need 2 more points to win.

## Action Options
1. **Play Knight Card** - This would move the robber and let me steal a resource
2. **Roll the Dice** - Get resources based on the roll

## Strategic Analysis

The robber is currently on the ore hex (0, 0, 0) with value 8, which is one of my own production hexes. By playing the Knight card, I can:
1. Move the robber away from my ore production
2. Place it on an opponent's high-value hex
3. Steal a resource from RED who is at 9 VP and close to winning

This is clearly better than rolling, where I might hit a 7 and have to place the robber anyway (without stealing). Plus, RED has 6 cards - giving me good odds of stealing something useful.

<plan>
1. Play Knight to move robber from my ore 8 hex onto RED's best production hex (either the ore/wheat 6 at node 4)
2. Steal a resource from RED, hoping for ore or wheat
3. Then roll for resources and continue executing my win strategy
4. With 3 hidden VP cards, I only need 2 more points - either another settlement (1 VP) plus another VP card (1 VP), or simply 2 more settlements
</plan>

Since I'm one move away from getting robbed of my crucial ore production, and RED is just 1 VP from winning, playing the Knight is the optimal move.

❓ Select action by number (0-17):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I need to analyze where to place the robber to maximize disruption to RED while minimizing impact on my own production.

First, let me understand the current game state:
- RED has 9 VP (needs just 1 more to win)
- I (BLUE) have 5 VP shown + 3 hidden VP cards = 8 VP total
- I need to block RED's progress while gaining 2 more VP
- RED has many roads (longest road) and multiple settlements/cities
- The robber is currently on my ore hex (0,0,0) with number 8

Looking at RED's buildings:
- RED has a city at node 4 producing ore(8), wheat(6), and sheep(5)
- RED's city at node 17 produces sheep(5), ore(5), and brick(4)
- RED also has settlements at nodes 23, 7, and 16

Since I need to block RED's production while allowing my own resources to flow, I should target their best production hex.

RED's city at node 4 is connected to the hex (0,0,0) [ore-8], (-1,0,1) [wheat-6], and (-1,1,0) [sheep-5]. The ore-8 hex is already blocked by the robber. The wheat-6 hex at (-1,0,1) is critical for RED's city, so that's an excellent target.

Looking at the action options:
- Option [2] is "Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED"
- This will block RED's wheat-6 production from their city at node 4
- This is a 6-value hex, one of the most productive numbers
- This hex doesn't produce anything for me, so I won't hurt my own production
- I'll also get to steal a resource from RED

This is clearly the optimal move as it blocks one of RED's best production hexes (wheat-6) connected to their city, slowing their progress toward their final VP.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 87 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Play Knight to move robber from my ore 8 hex onto RED's best production hex (either the ore/wheat 6 at node 4)
2. Steal a resource from RED, hoping for ore or wheat
3. Then roll for resources and continue executing my win strategy
4. With 3 hidden VP cards, I only need 2 more points - either another settlement (1 VP) plus another VP card (1 VP), or simply 2 more settlements
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.
  To adjust your plan, provide a NEW PLAN in your reasoning with <plan>your new plan</plan>

❓ Select action by number (0-17):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the game state and determine the best robber placement for my ore-wheat strategy.

First, let me understand where I stand:
- I have 5 visible VP (1 settlement + 1 city + Largest Army)
- I have 3 hidden VP cards = 8 total VP out of 10 needed
- I only need 2 more VP to win
- I currently have 1 Wood and 2 Ore
- Red is at 9 VP and very close to winning

Since I need to place the robber, I should target RED's most valuable production to slow them down while potentially gaining a useful resource.

Looking at RED's settlements and cities:
- RED's city at node 4 produces Ore (8), Wheat (6), and Sheep (5) - extremely valuable!
- RED's city at node 17 produces Sheep (5), Ore (5), and Brick (4)
- Other settlements have lower value production

The hex (0, 0, 0) is Ore 8 and connects to RED's city at node 4.
The hex (-1, 0, 1) is Wheat 6 and also connects to RED's city at node 4.

Placing the robber on either of these hexes would significantly impact RED's production. However:
1. The Wheat 6 hex is currently where the robber is located
2. The Ore 8 hex also affects my settlement at node 2

Looking at the other high-value options:
- Hex (1, 0, -1) is Sheep 8 and affects RED's settlement at node 23
- Hex (0, 1, -1) is Wheat 11 and affects RED's settlement at node 16

Since I'm executing my ore-wheat strategy, I should prioritize blocking RED's access to these resources. The highest impact move would be to target the Ore 8 hex even though it also affects my production, as it's RED's most valuable hex and they have a city there, not just a settlement.

However, since I also depend on Ore production, I should consider the hex (0, 1, -1) which is Wheat 11 and affects RED's settlement at node 16. This would slow RED down without hurting my own production.

<plan>
1. Move robber to Wheat 11 hex (0, 1, -1) to block RED's wheat production
2. Steal a resource from RED, hopefully ore or wheat
3. Continue focusing on getting resources for one more settlement and final VP card
4. With my 3 hidden VP cards, I only need 2 more points to win
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I'll choose action [4] - Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED.

# Game Analysis for Turn 89

Let me analyze the current game state carefully to make an optimal decision.

## Current Situation:
- I have 5 visible VP plus 3 hidden VP cards = 8 total VP
- I need 2 more VP to win
- Resources: 1 Wood, 2 Wheat, 3 Ore
- Opponent (RED) has 9 VP (very close to winning)
- The robber is already on wheat hex (0,1,-1)
- My only available action is to either end my turn [0] or build a city [1]

## Option Analysis:

**Option 0 - End Turn:**
- I don't use my resources
- I keep 1 wood, 2 wheat, 3 ore for next turn
- Risk: RED might win on their next turn as they have 9 VP

**Option 1 - Build City at node 2:**
- Costs: 2 wheat, 3 ore (which I have exactly)
- Benefits:
  - Increases my visible VP from 5 to 6 (total would be 9 VP with my hidden cards)
  - Doubles my production at node 2 (ore 8, ore 12, wood 2)
  - Significantly improves ore production which is crucial for my strategy
- After building: I'd have 1 wood, 0 wheat, 0 ore

## Strategic Considerations:
1. RED has 9 VP and may win next turn, so I need to maximize my progress
2. Upgrading to a city follows my ore-wheat strategy by increasing ore production
3. With the city upgrade, I'd have 9 VP total (6 visible + 3 hidden) and need just 1 more VP
4. The city at node 2 improves my ore production on high-probability ore hex (8)

<plan>
1. Build city at node 2 now to reach 9 VP (including hidden VP cards)
2. Next turn, aim to buy one more VP card with improved ore production
3. Alternatively, build a settlement if resources allow
4. With 3 hidden VP cards, I only need 1 more point to win
</plan>

Given the situation, my best move is to build the city at node 2, increasing my ore production and bringing me to 9 VP total.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 1 | Player: BLUE | Action: BUILD_INITIAL_SETTLEMENT

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build city at node 2 now to reach 9 VP (including hidden VP cards)
2. Next turn, aim to buy one more VP card with improved ore production
3. Alternatively, build a settlement if resources allow
4. With 3 hidden VP cards, I only need 1 more point to win
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.
  To adjust your plan, provide a NEW PLAN in your reasoning with <plan>your new plan</plan>

# Initial Settlement Placement Analysis

I'm currently in the first turn of the game, placing my first settlement. This is a critical decision that will significantly impact my game trajectory. I need to follow the ore-wheat strategy, so I should prioritize high-probability ore and wheat hexes.

## Resource Hex Analysis:
- Best Wheat hexes: 🌾6 (-2,2,0), 🌾10 (-1,-1,2), 🌾11 (-1,1,0), 🌾11 (0,2,-2)
- Best Ore hexes: ⛏️9 (0,-1,1), ⛏️8 (not present)
- High value hexes: 🧱8 (-2,0,2), 🐑8 (-2,1,1), 🌲9 (0,1,-1)

## Best Settlement Locations:

Looking at nodes that intersect with high-value wheat and ore:
- Node 13: Connects 🧱8 (very good), 🌾10 (excellent), 🐑3 (poor)
- Node 11: Connects ⛏️9 (excellent), 🌾10 (excellent), ⛏️3 (poor)
- Node 17: Connects 🐑8 (very good), 🌾6 (very good), 🌾11 (excellent)
- Node 2: Connects ⛏️9 (excellent), ⛏️4 (poor), 🌲6 (very good)

For the ore-wheat strategy, node 11 gives me both ore and wheat with excellent probabilities. Node 17 gives me wheat from two different hexes with good probabilities, plus sheep.

## Port Considerations:
- Ore port at nodes 40, 44
- Wheat port at nodes 35, 36
- These could be valuable for my strategy later

## Final Decision:
Node 11 offers the best combination for the ore-wheat strategy with access to both ore (9) and wheat (10), which are high probability numbers. This will give me strong production of both key resources right from the start.

<plan>
1. Place first settlement at node 11 to secure high-probability ore (9) and wheat (10)
2. Place second settlement on the opposite side of the board to secure additional wheat or ore production
3. Focus on city upgrades as quickly as possible
4. Build roads toward ore port or wheat port if needed
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Analyzing Initial Road Placement for Blue

Let me think through the best road placement for my initial settlement. I've placed my first settlement at node 11, which is excellent for the ore-wheat strategy as it produces ore (9 - high probability) and wheat (10 - good probability).

My goal now is to place my road to maximize future expansion opportunities while supporting my ore-wheat strategy.

## Examining Options:
- **Option 0: Road at edge (11, 12)** - Points east toward node 12, which connects to wheat (10), ore (9), and sheep (3).
- **Option 1: Road at edge (10, 11)** - Points west toward node 10, which connects to ore (9), ore (3), and brick (4).
- **Option 2: Road at edge (11, 32)** - Points southwest toward node 32, which connects to ore (3), wheat (10), and is near the general 3:1 port.

## Evaluating Future Expansion:
1. From node 12, I could expand to:
   - Node 13: Connects to wheat (10), brick (8), sheep (3)
   - Node 3: Already taken by RED player
   - Node 34: Near wheat port and brick (8), wheat (10) resources

2. From node 10, I could expand to:
   - Node 29: Near the brick 2:1 port, with brick (4), ore (3) resources
   - Node 9: Access to brick (4), ore (4), ore (9)
   - Node 2: Access to ore (4), ore (9), wood (6)

3. From node 32, I could expand to:
   - Node 31: Access to ore (3) resource
   - Node 33: Near the general port, with wheat (10) resource
   - Node 34: Near wheat port with brick (8), wheat (10)

## Strategic Analysis:
The best option should align with my ore-wheat strategy while enabling me to secure resources I'm lacking. My current settlement produces ore and wheat, but lacks good wood, brick, and sheep production.

Option 0 (edge 11-12) opens paths to more wheat and sheep access, plus potentially a wheat port through node 34.

Option 1 (edge 10-11) gives me access to more ore and brick resources, and a path to the brick port.

Option 2 (edge 11-32) provides access to the general port and wheat port, which could be valuable for my ore-wheat strategy.

<plan>
1. Place first settlement at node 11 (done) securing ore and wheat production
2. Place first road toward node 12, enabling expansion to more wheat and potential wheat port access
3. Place second settlement on a hex with good wood and/or brick production
4. Focus on city upgrades as quickly as possible, particularly at node 11
5. Get development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
</plan>

Based on my analysis, I believe Option 0 (road at edge 11-12) provides the best path forward. It opens expansion toward additional wheat production and potential wheat port access, which aligns perfectly with my ore-wheat strategy.

# Initial Settlement Analysis for Ore-Wheat Strategy

I need to place my second initial settlement to maximize my chances of winning with an ore-wheat focused strategy. This is a crucial decision that will impact the entire game.

Let me analyze the best options by looking at:

1) Resource combinations
2) Probability values (pips)
3) Port access
4) Future expansion potential
5) Complementing my first settlement

## My First Settlement Assessment
- Already have moderate ore production (⛏️9[⭐⭐], ⛏️3[⭐]) and some wheat (🌾10[⭐])
- Currently lacking wood, brick, and sheep production
- Need to select a second settlement far away to maximize board coverage

## Best Node Options:
Node 17: 🌾6[⭐⭐⭐], 🐑8[⭐⭐], 🌾11[⭐] - Great wheat production, sheep, near wood port
Node 14: 🧱8[⭐⭐], 🐑3[⭐], 🐑8[⭐⭐] - Good brick, some sheep, near wheat port
Node 20: 🌲5[⭐], 🌲9[⭐⭐], 🐑10[⭐] - Strong wood production, some sheep
Node 23: 🧱2[⭐], 🌲5[⭐], 🐑12[⭐] - Some wood, brick, sheep, near sheep port
Node 35/36: Near wheat port with brick and sheep
Node 40: Near ore port with wheat

## Strategic Evaluation
Node 17 stands out as the strongest option because:
1. Excellent wheat production with 6+11 (high probability numbers)
2. Adds sheep production (missing from my first settlement)
3. Located on opposite side of board from my first settlement
4. Near wood port for trading flexibility
5. Has wood port nearby for future accessibility
6. Strong location for early city upgrade (wheat+ore strategy)

<plan>
1. Place second initial settlement at node 17 to secure strong wheat production
2. Focus on getting at least one more settlement in early game for wood/brick
3. Prioritize upgrading my initial settlements to cities (especially node 11 and 17)
4. Use the wood port to trade for needed resources when necessary
5. Buy development cards when I have excess sheep/wheat/ore
</plan>

Given my ore-wheat strategy focus, node 17 provides the strongest wheat production and complements my first settlement perfectly.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 1 | Player: BLUE | Action: BUILD_INITIAL_ROAD

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Place second initial settlement at node 17 to secure strong wheat production
2. Focus on getting at least one more settlement in early game for wood/brick

4. Use the wood port to trade for needed resources when necessary
5. Buy development cards when I have excess sheep/wheat/ore

# Initial Road Placement Analysis

I need to choose an initial road placement for my second settlement at node 17, which will be critical to my expansion strategy.

Let me analyze the options:

## Option 0: Road at edge (17, 39)
- Direction: South/Southeast
- Leads toward: Node 39 which connects to the 2:1 Wood port (nodes 38, 39)
- Future expansion: Could provide access to wheat port later (nodes 35, 36)
- Resource hexes nearby: 🐑8, 🌾6

## Option 1: Road at edge (15, 17)
- Direction: Northwest
- Leads toward: Node 15, which connects to 🐑3 and 🌾11 hexes
- Future expansion: Limited, as it points back toward my first settlement area

## Option 2: Road at edge (17, 18)
- Direction: Northeast
- Leads toward: Node 18, which is on a 🌾6 hex
- Future expansion: Potentially toward wheat-rich area and wheat port
- Could help secure the wheat port eventually

## Strategic Analysis:

In the ore-wheat strategy, I need to:
1. Protect my expansion options
2. Focus on upgrading to cities quickly
3. Secure additional resources I'm lacking (particularly wood/brick for initial expansion)

I notice that:
- My settlement at node 17 already produces excellent wheat (🌾11[⭐], 🌾6[⭐⭐⭐]) and sheep (🐑8[⭐⭐⭐])
- My settlement at node 11 produces ore (⛏️9[⭐⭐], ⛏️3[⭐]) and some wheat (🌾10[⭐])
- I'm lacking good production of wood and brick, which I'll need for initial expansion

Option 0 (road to 39) is most strategic because:
- It leads toward the 2:1 wood port, which will be valuable since I don't have good wood production
- It creates expansion options southward in an area away from my first settlement
- This follows the principle of expanding in opposite directions
- Having access to the wood port will help me convert sheep (which I'll produce well) into wood

<plan>
1. Build initial road toward the wood port (edge 17,39)
2. Focus on securing another settlement with good wood/brick production
3. Prioritize upgrading my settlements at nodes 11 and 17 to cities
4. Use the wood port to trade excess sheep for wood when needed
5. Buy development cards when I have excess sheep/wheat/ore

# Game Analysis: Settlers of Catan Turn 5

Let me thoroughly analyze my current position, resources, and available actions to determine the optimal move.

## Current Resources
- 1 sheep
- 4 wheat

## Current Position Assessment
- I have two settlements:
  - Node 11: produces ore (3, 9) and wheat (10)
  - Node 17: produces wheat (6, 11) and sheep (8)
- I have roads at (11, 12) and (17, 39)
- My settlements give me good wheat production but I'm lacking in brick and wood for expansion
- I'm following an ore-wheat strategy with good wheat income but need to improve ore production

## Available Actions
1-4: Trade 4 wheat for various resources
0: End turn

## Strategic Analysis
I have 4 wheat cards, which I could trade for another resource. The key question is: should I trade now or wait to collect more resources?

For my ore-wheat strategy, I want to:
1. Upgrade settlements to cities (requires 3 ore + 2 wheat per city)
2. Buy development cards (requires 1 ore + 1 wheat + 1 sheep)

Currently I have:
- Not enough resources for a city (need 3 ore)
- Almost enough for a development card (have wheat + sheep, need 1 ore)

Given my current roads, I can't build a new settlement without more brick/wood. My immediate need is ore to either buy a development card or save toward a city.

Trading 4 wheat for 1 ore (option 2) would give me exactly what I need for a development card on my next turn if I can get a sheep from my node 17 production.

<plan>
1. Trade 4 wheat for 1 ore now
2. Next turn, use ore + wheat + sheep (if rolled) to buy a development card
3. Continue focusing on upgrading settlements at nodes 11 and 17 to cities
4. Consider expanding toward good brick/wood hex if needed for controlled expansion
5. Use development cards (especially knights) strategically to protect high-value hexes
</plan>

Following the ore-wheat strategy, I should trade now to get ore which is crucial for both cities and development cards. Trading 4:1 isn't ideal efficiency, but having ore now positions me better for upcoming turns.

Therefore, my optimal move is to trade wheat for ore.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 7 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Trade 4 wheat for 1 ore now
2. Next turn, use ore + wheat + sheep (if rolled) to buy a development card
3. Continue focusing on upgrading settlements at nodes 11 and 17 to cities
4. Consider expanding toward good brick/wood hex if needed for controlled expansion
5. Use development cards (especially knights) strategically to protect high-value hexes
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis: Robber Placement Decision

I need to analyze where to place the robber to maximize my strategic position following the ore-wheat strategy. Let me consider my options carefully.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 2 settlements: one at node 11 (⛏️9, ⛏️3, 🌾10) and one at node 17 (🌾11, 🐑8, 🌾6)
- My resources: 1 sheep and 1 ore
- My opponent (RED) has 3 hidden cards
- RED has settlements at nodes 3 and 13

## Strategic Priority
For the ore-wheat strategy, I need to:
1. Protect my own high-value ore/wheat production
2. Disrupt RED's high-value production, especially ore/wheat
3. Potentially steal a valuable resource

## Analyzing RED's Production
RED has the following resource hexes:
- Node 3: 🌲6[⭐⭐⭐], ⛏️9[⭐⭐], 🐑3[⭐]
- Node 13: 🐑3[⭐], 🌾10[⭐], 🧱8[⭐⭐⭐]

The most valuable hexes for RED are:
1. Wood 6 (high probability)
2. Ore 9 (ore is crucial for cities)
3. Brick 8 (high probability)

## Robber Placement Options
The best options appear to be:
- Option [0]: Block Wood 6 (high probability - 3 dots) and steal from RED
- Option [2]: Block Ore 9 (blocks both RED and ME - not ideal since I need ore)
- Option [11]: Block Brick 8 (high probability - 3 dots) and steal from RED

Since I'm following the ore-wheat strategy, I should prioritize blocking RED's access to ore (which helps them build cities) or high-probability resources that give them building advantage.

Option [0] is compelling because it blocks RED's highest probability hex (Wood 6), which provides a significant advantage for road and settlement building. This would slow down RED's expansion.

Option [11] blocks RED's Brick 8, which is also high probability and important for expansion.

I won't choose Option [2] since it blocks Ore 9 which I also produce at node 11 - I don't want to hurt my own ore production.

<plan>
1. Block RED's high-probability Wood 6 to slow their expansion
2. Trade for ore (using wheat or the 3:1 port) when possible
3. Focus on upgrading my settlements to cities
4. Consider expansion toward better ore production hex when feasible
5. Save resources for development cards if I get excess sheep+wheat+ore
</plan>

After careful consideration, the best robber placement is Option [0], which blocks RED's high-probability Wood 6 hex and allows me to steal a card from RED. This hampers their expansion ability while potentially giving me a useful resource.

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and my options:

## Current Resources
- 3 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore

## Victory Points
- I have 2 VP from my 2 settlements
- RED also has 2 VP

## Available Actions
1. Buy a development card (costs 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore)
2. End turn

## Strategic Analysis

My current plan focuses on:
1. Blocking RED's high-probability wood
2. Trading for ore
3. Focusing on city upgrades
4. Expanding to better ore production
5. Getting development cards with excess resources

Looking at my current situation:
- I have exactly the resources needed to buy a development card
- Development cards can provide several benefits:
  - Knight cards (14 of 25 cards) let me move the robber and help toward largest army (2 VP)
  - Victory point cards (5 of 25) give me hidden VP
  - Year of Plenty or Monopoly could help me gather resources for cities
- I cannot build a road, settlement, or city this turn
- The robber is currently on the wood hex (0,0,0) with probability 6, which is already blocking RED's high-probability wood

## Decision Logic

Buying a development card has several strategic advantages:
1. It could give me a hidden VP card (~20% chance)
2. Knights can help protect my high-value hexes and work toward largest army
3. Progress cards can help me get resources for city upgrades
4. It helps thin my hand which is already at 5 cards (approaching the 7-card limit)
5. Fits my ore-wheat strategy by investing resources now for potential future benefits

The alternative is to end my turn with these resources, but that doesn't advance my position and risks losing cards to the robber if another player rolls a 7.

<plan>
1. Buy development card now
2. Continue focusing on gathering ore and wheat for city upgrades
3. Use any knights strategically to block opponent's high-probability resources
4. Save any VP cards until I can win in a single turn
5. Prepare to expand toward better ore production when resources allow
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I should buy a development card with my current resources.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

I need to decide whether to play my Knight card now or roll the dice for my turn.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 2 VP from my 2 settlements
- I hold 1 sheep resource and 1 Knight development card
- My settlements are at nodes 11 and 17
  - Node 11 produces ore (3, 9) and wheat (10)
  - Node 17 produces wheat (6, 11) and sheep (8)
- The robber is currently on the wheat hex (-1, 1, 0) with value 11
  - This is blocking one of my wheat producers at node 17
- My opponent has 4 hidden resource cards

## Action Options Analysis

**Option 0: Play Knight Card**
- Benefits:
  - Remove robber from my wheat (11) hex, restoring production
  - Steal one of opponent's 4 cards
  - Work toward largest army (2 VP)
- Drawbacks:
  - Knight card may be more valuable later
  - I'd still need to roll after playing the knight

**Option 1: Roll Dice**
- Benefits:
  - Might get lucky and receive resources even with robber on my hex
  - Can save Knight card for future strategic use
- Drawbacks:
  - The robber remains on my wheat production hex

## Strategic Considerations
1. Playing the Knight now would unblock my wheat production, which aligns with my ore-wheat strategy
2. I only have 1 sheep resource, so a roll might be needed to gain more resources for building
3. I could save the Knight for future turns when I might have more information about my opponent's strategy

Given that:
- The robber is currently blocking one of my best wheat producers (11)
- Wheat is critical to my city-focused strategy
- I can steal a card from my opponent
- My hand is small (only 1 sheep), so the risk of losing resources to a 7 roll is minimal

<plan>
1. Play Knight to unblock my wheat production and steal a resource from opponent
2. Roll for resources
3. Focus on gathering ore and wheat for city upgrades
4. Save any VP cards until I can win in a single turn
5. Consider building roads toward potential settlement locations with good ore
</plan>

The optimal action is to play my Knight card to unblock my valuable wheat production.

# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to make a strategic robber placement that will simultaneously hurt my opponent (RED) while potentially giving me useful resources.

Let me analyze the options:

## RED's Production Potential
RED has settlements at nodes 3 and 13 producing:
- Node 3: 🌲6[⭐⭐⭐], ⛏️9[⭐⭐], 🐑3[⭐]
- Node 13: 🐑3[⭐], 🌾10[⭐], 🧱8[⭐⭐⭐]

## My Strategy Requirements
Following the ore-wheat strategy, I should:
1. Protect my own ore/wheat production
2. Block RED's high-value production, especially ore/wheat
3. Target hexes where I can steal useful resources (preferably ore/wheat)

## Evaluating Options
- Option [0]: Block 🌲6 (wood) - hurts RED significantly (⭐⭐⭐) but wood isn't critical for my city strategy
- Option [2]: Block ⛏️9 (ore) - excellent target as it reduces RED's ore production while also affecting my own (acceptable trade-off)
- Option [9]: Block 🌾10 (wheat) - good target as wheat is critical for city building
- Option [10]: Block 🧱8 (brick) - hurts RED (⭐⭐⭐) but brick isn't critical for my ore-wheat strategy
- Option [11]: Block 🐑8 (sheep) - not optimal as sheep is less important

Looking at the highest impact options that align with my ore-wheat strategy:

### Option [2]: Blocking ore hex (0, -1, 1) with value 9
- Denies RED 2 pips of ore production
- I also lose some ore production, but the net effect hurts RED more than me
- Chance to steal from RED (possibly ore/wheat)

### Option [9]: Blocking wheat hex (-1, -1, 2) with value 10
- Denies RED 1 pip of wheat production
- Chance to steal from RED
- Wheat is critical for both settlements and cities

Since my primary strategy is to accumulate ore and wheat for city building, and RED likely needs the same resources, I should prioritize blocking their access to these resources.

<plan>
1. Block RED's high-probability ore or wheat production
2. Roll for resources and focus on collecting ore and wheat for city upgrades
3. Aim to build a third settlement only if it provides critical resources (ore/wheat) 
4. Focus on upgrading settlements to cities as soon as possible
5. Consider development cards if I have excess sheep/wheat/ore
</plan>

Given RED has 4 hidden cards, they may have accumulated resources for a significant build. Blocking their ore production at the 9-value hex will be most impactful for slowing their progress toward city building while giving me a chance to steal a valuable resource.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 11 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Block RED's high-probability ore or wheat production
2. Roll for resources and focus on collecting ore and wheat for city upgrades
3. Aim to build a third settlement only if it provides critical resources (ore/wheat) 
4. Focus on upgrading settlements to cities as soon as possible
5. Consider development cards if I have excess sheep/wheat/ore

❓ Select action by number (0-17):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the game state and determine the optimal robber placement as part of my ore-wheat strategy.

First, let me identify the most productive hexes for RED that I could block:

- RED has a settlement at node 3, producing from:
  * 🌲6 (0,0,0) - high-value wood [⭐⭐⭐]
  * ⛏️9 (0,-1,1) - high-value ore [⭐⭐] - currently blocked
  * 🐑3 (-1,0,1) - low-value sheep [⭐]

- RED has a settlement at node 13, producing from:
  * 🐑3 (-1,0,1) - low-value sheep [⭐]
  * 🌾10 (-1,-1,2) - high-value wheat [⭐]
  * 🧱8 (-2,0,2) - high-value brick [⭐⭐⭐]

Since I'm pursuing the ore-wheat strategy, I should prioritize blocking RED's access to these resources, especially high-probability spots. Looking at my options:

Option [0]: Move robber to (0,0,0) and steal from RED - This blocks RED's wood 6 [⭐⭐⭐], which is high-value.
Option [9]: Move robber to (-1,-1,2) and steal from RED - This blocks RED's wheat 10 [⭐].
Option [10]: Move robber to (-2,0,2) and steal from RED - This blocks RED's brick 8 [⭐⭐⭐].

Among these, blocking ore or wheat would be most aligned with my strategy, but RED's ore hex is already blocked. The wheat hex at (-1,-1,2) is a 10, which is a good production number, and blocking it supports my strategy of limiting RED's access to wheat.

I'll consider one more important factor: stealing. By placing the robber on any of these options, I'll be able to steal a resource from RED. Since RED has 3 cards, there's a good chance I might get ore or wheat, which would directly support my strategy.

<plan>
1. Block RED's wheat production to restrict their ability to build cities
2. Continue focusing on collecting ore and wheat for city upgrades
3. Aim to build a third settlement only if it provides critical resources
4. Prioritize upgrading settlements to cities as soon as possible
5. Consider development cards if excess resources are available
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I'll choose option [9] to move the robber to (-1,-1,2) and steal from RED, blocking their wheat production.

- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 19 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Block RED's wheat production to restrict their ability to build cities
2. Continue focusing on collecting ore and wheat for city upgrades
3. Aim to build a third settlement only if it provides critical resources
4. Prioritize upgrading settlements to cities as soon as possible
5. Consider development cards if excess resources are available

RESPONSE:
# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state carefully to make the optimal decision:

## Current Resources
I have: 1 🧱BRICK, 3 🐑SHEEP, 3 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE

## Victory Points
- I have 2 VP (from 2 settlements)
- Red also has 2 VP (from 2 settlements)

## Production Assessment
- Settlement at node 11: ⛏️9[⭐⭐], ⛏️3[⭐], 🌾10[⭐] - good ore and wheat production
- Settlement at node 17: 🌾11[⭐], 🐑8[⭐⭐⭐], 🌾6[⭐⭐⭐] - excellent wheat and sheep production

This confirms my ore-wheat strategy is working - I have good access to both key resources.

## Action Options
1. Buy a development card (1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE)
2. End my turn

## Development Card Analysis
- Could provide: Knight (move robber), Victory Point (hidden), Year of Plenty, Monopoly, or Road Building
- Knights help get largest army (2 VP) - I already have 1 knight played
- Victory point cards are worth 1 VP each
- Utility cards can help resolve resource bottlenecks

## Strategic Considerations
- I'm pursuing the ore-wheat city strategy, which means I need to accumulate ore and wheat
- Development cards are valuable in this strategy for knights (largest army) and VP cards
- I have exactly the resources needed for a development card
- By spending 1 sheep, 1 wheat, and 1 ore, I'll still have resources for future turns
- With my production power, I should recover these resources quickly

## Decision
Since I have the exact resources for a development card and it aligns with my ore-wheat strategy, I should buy one. It could potentially give me a VP card, help build largest army, or provide utility.

<plan>
1. Buy development cards to work toward largest army (2VP) and hidden VP cards
2. Continue collecting ore and wheat for city upgrades
3. Upgrade settlements to cities as soon as possible (prioritizing node 17 for its excellent wheat production)
4. Consider a third settlement only if it provides critical resources
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

❓ Select action by number (0-1):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state and determine the best action for maximizing my chances of winning with the ore-wheat strategy.

**Current Game Analysis:**
- I have 2 VP from my 2 settlements
- RED has 4 VP (2 settlements + 2 VP from longest road)
- I have 2 sheep, 2 wheat, and 1 road building development card
- I'm positioned on good wheat hexes (10, 11, 6) but need better ore production
- Robber is currently on a wheat hex (-1, 1, 0) which could affect my production

**Action Options:**
1. Option 0: Play Road Building card
   - This would allow me to build two free roads
   - I could extend toward potential settlement locations or work toward longest road

2. Option 1: Roll the dice
   - This would generate resources based on the roll
   - Could help collect more resources for my next build

**Strategic Analysis:**
The road building card is very valuable for me right now because:
- I need to expand to get better ore production (my ore spots are only 3 and 9, with limited production)
- I can potentially work toward longest road (currently RED has it with 5 segments)
- Building roads without using wood/brick preserves those resources for settlements

Looking at potential expansion routes, I could:
- Connect from node 17 toward the 2:1 ore port at nodes 40,44
- Connect from node 11 toward better ore production

<plan>
1. Play road building to expand toward the ore port from node 17 (build roads to nodes 39-40 and 40-44)
2. Focus on collecting ore and wheat for city upgrades, with priority on upgrading node 17 for its excellent wheat production
3. Consider building a settlement at node 40 to secure the ore port
4. Continue working toward largest army by buying development cards when possible
</plan>

Given my current resources and position, the optimal choice is to play the road building card to expand my options without spending limited resources.

# Game Analysis for Blue Player's Turn

Let me analyze my current situation and available options:

## Current Game State
- I have 2 settlements (node 11 and node 17)
- I have 2 sheep and 2 wheat resources
- I have 2 VP total (from my 2 settlements)
- Red has 4 VP (2 settlements + Longest Road)
- The robber is on a wheat hex (-1, 1, 0) that produces on an 11

## My Resources
- With my current resources (2 sheep, 2 wheat), I cannot:
  - Build a road (need 1 wood, 1 brick)
  - Build a settlement (need 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 sheep, 1 wheat)
  - Upgrade to a city (need 3 ore, 2 wheat)
  - Buy a development card (need 1 ore, 1 sheep, 1 wheat)

## Action Options Analysis
Since I don't have the resources to build a road (I need wood and brick), none of the road building options (0-5) are immediately executable. 

## Strategic Direction
My current plan involves:
1. Using Road Building card to expand toward ore port (nodes 39-40-44)
2. Focus on collecting ore/wheat for city upgrades
3. Consider settlement at node 40 for ore port
4. Work toward largest army via development cards

However, I don't have resources to build anything this turn, and I'm not being prompted with trading options or development card options. The only actions shown are road building options that I cannot afford.

I need to carefully review the available options again. It seems the game might be expecting me to end my turn (since I can't build anything) or there might be a development card I could play that I'm overlooking.

Since I only have road building options (0-5) listed, and none of them are currently possible with my resources, I should pass my turn. However, since I must select an option from 0-5, I will choose the most strategic road location for when I do get the resources.

<plan>
1. Pass turn (since I can't build with current resources)
2. Focus on collecting brick and wood next for road expansion toward ore port
3. Continue with the ore-wheat strategy for city upgrades
4. Target settlement at node 40 to secure the ore port
5. Work toward largest army when possible
</plan>

Since I must select a road location option, I'll pick the one that best advances my path to the ore port:

\boxed{1}

Option 1 builds a road at edge (38, 39) which extends from my settlement at node 17 toward the ore port, aligning with my strategic plan.
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 21 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Pass turn (since I can't build with current resources)
2. Focus on collecting brick and wood next for road expansion toward ore port
3. Continue with the ore-wheat strategy for city upgrades
4. Target settlement at node 40 to secure the ore port
5. Work toward largest army when possible

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the game state carefully:

## Current Resources
I have 2 sheep and 2 wheat - not enough for any building option. I need wood and brick for roads, ore for development cards, and various combinations for settlements and cities.

## Victory Point Status
- I have 2 VP (from 2 settlements)
- Red has 4 VP (2 settlements + longest road bonus)

## Available Actions
All available actions (0-5) are road building options, which require 1 wood and 1 brick. I don't have these resources.

## My Settlements
- Settlement at node 11: produces ore (3, 9) and wheat (10)
- Settlement at node 17: produces sheep (8) and wheat (6, 11) 
- Note: wheat (11) currently has the robber on it, blocking production

## Strategic Analysis
1. I can't build anything with my current resources
2. My settlements provide good ore and wheat production, aligning with the ore-wheat strategy
3. I need wood and brick to expand with roads
4. The ore port at nodes 40/44 would be valuable for my strategy

Since I don't have resources to build anything, the only reasonable action is to pass my turn.

<plan>
1. Pass turn
2. Continue focusing on collecting brick and wood for road expansion
3. Target ore port via node 40 for better ore trading
4. Work towards cities and largest army
5. Watch out for Red who already has a 2 VP lead
</plan>

None of the options 0-5 can be executed since I lack the necessary resources. Therefore:

RESPONSE:
# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze my current situation and options:

## Current Resources
- 2 🐑SHEEP
- 2 🌾WHEAT
- 1 ⛏️ORE

## Victory Points
- I'm at 2/10 VP while RED is at 4/10 VP (including +2 for Longest Road)
- RED has a 2-point lead

## Build Options
With my current resources, I can:
1. Buy a development card (costs 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE)
2. End my turn without building

## Strategic Considerations

1. **Development Card Option:**
   - Could give me a Victory Point card (immediate hidden progress)
   - Could give me a Knight (helps toward Largest Army bonus)
   - Could give me a helpful action card (Monopoly, Year of Plenty, Road Building)
   - Aligns with ore-wheat city strategy by using sheep (which isn't as critical)
   - Would use all my strategic resources (ore and wheat)

2. **Ending Turn Option:**
   - Preserves resources for potential city upgrade (need 3 ore, 2 wheat)
   - I'm currently 2 ore short of a city upgrade
   - Next roll might give me more resources to work with

3. **Game Status:**
   - RED has Longest Road (+2 VP) and 4 total VP
   - I'm 2 VP behind
   - The robber is on the 11 wheat hex, which is unfortunate

## Decision Making

Following the ore-wheat strategy, I need to focus on city upgrades and development cards. Since I have exactly the right resources for a development card, and I have strong wheat production, this is a good opportunity to get a development card that could help me toward Largest Army or give me a VP.

Getting a Knight would help protect my valuable wheat hexes from the robber and contribute toward Largest Army (2VP). A Victory Point card would be an immediate hidden advancement. Other development cards would provide tactical advantages.

<plan>
1. Buy development card now
2. Focus on collecting ore for city upgrades (need 2 more ore)
3. Target ore port via node 40 for better ore trading
4. Work toward largest army to match RED's bonus
5. Upgrade one settlement to a city as soon as possible
</plan>

I'll buy a development card which fits my ore-wheat strategy by potentially giving me a hidden VP, Knight for protection and Largest Army, or utility cards.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

❓ Select action by number (0-1):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I need to analyze my options carefully to determine the best action for this turn.

## Current Game State Analysis
- I'm BLUE with 2 VP (2 settlements)
- RED has 4 VP (2 settlements + longest road)
- I have 1 ROAD_BUILDING development card available to play
- My resources: 1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE
- My current plan involves buying development cards and working toward the ore port (node 40)

## Action 0: Play Road Building Card
If I choose this action, I can build two roads for free. Looking at my current position:
- I have roads leading from node 17 toward node 41
- I'm trying to reach the ore port at nodes 40/44
- To reach node 40, I would need roads at (41, 40) and (40, 44)
- This would give me direct access to the 2:1 ore port, which aligns perfectly with my ore-wheat strategy

## Action 1: Roll the Dice
If I roll, I'll get more resources based on the outcome, but:
- I only have 3 resources total right now (1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore)
- I can't build anything significant with these resources
- Even with a good roll, I might not get enough resources for a city (need 3 ore + 2 wheat)
- I might not even get enough for a development card (need 1 ore + 1 wheat + 1 sheep)

## Strategic Considerations
1. The ore port is crucial for my ore-wheat strategy, as it will allow me to trade 2 ore for 1 of any resource
2. Getting to the ore port now would give me a significant advantage for city building
3. The ROAD_BUILDING card gives me free infrastructure that would otherwise cost 2 brick + 2 wood
4. My current plan already mentions targeting the ore port via node 40

<plan>
1. Use road building card now to reach the ore port at node 40
2. Roll next turn to collect more resources
3. Focus on collecting ore and wheat for city upgrades
4. Use the ore port to convert excess ore to resources I need
5. Continue working toward largest army
6. Upgrade one settlement to a city as soon as possible
</plan>

Given my analysis, playing the ROAD_BUILDING card is the clearly superior option. It advances my position without using resources, gives me access to a critical port for my strategy, and sets me up for better trades in future turns.

# Game Analysis for Turn 29

I need to analyze the board state carefully and choose the best action based on my ore-wheat city-focused strategy.

## Current Status Assessment
- I have 2VP (two settlements)
- Resources: 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore
- Played cards: 1 knight, 2 road building cards (I've just played my road building card)
- I need to select where to build my free roads from the road building card

## Resource Production Assessment
My settlements are:
- Node 11: Produces ore (3 & 9) and wheat (10)
- Node 17: Produces wheat (6 & 11) and sheep (8)

This gives me good wheat production and some ore, aligning with my strategy.

## Strategic Priorities
1. I need to improve my ore production for city upgrades
2. I should build roads toward potential settlement locations
3. Accessing the ore port would help my strategy tremendously

## Road Building Options Analysis
Let me analyze each option:

[0] Road at edge (10, 11) - This doesn't advance toward any useful settlement spots or ports.

[1] Road at edge (37, 38) - I already have roads at (38, 39), so this doesn't open new opportunities.

[2] Road at edge (15, 17) - I already have a settlement at node 17, so this doesn't help expansion.

[3] Road at edge (41, 42) - This continues my path from node 39→41→42, getting me closer to the ore port at nodes 40/44.

[4] Road at edge (11, 32) - This builds toward potential settlement locations but doesn't prioritize access to the ore port.

[5] Road at edge (17, 18) - This builds toward the wheat port, which is less valuable than the ore port for my strategy.

## Decision
Option [3] is clearly the best choice as it continues my path toward the ore port (nodes 40/44) which will be crucial for my ore-wheat strategy. After building this road, I'll need just one more road to reach the ore port.

<plan>
1. Build free road to node 42 now (from road building card)
2. Build second free road from node 42 to node 40 to reach the ore port
3. Roll next turn to collect more resources
4. Use the ore port to optimize my resources
5. Focus on upgrading settlements to cities (need 3 ore + 2 wheat each)
6. Continue working toward largest army
</plan>

Since I want to place my roads to reach the ore port as efficiently as possible, the best choice is:

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 29 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build free road to node 42 now (from road building card)
2. Build second free road from node 42 to node 40 to reach the ore port
3. Roll next turn to collect more resources
4. Use the ore port to optimize my resources
5. Focus on upgrading settlements to cities (need 3 ore + 2 wheat each)
6. Continue working toward largest army

# Game Analysis & Decision

Let me carefully analyze the game state and make the best decision for my ore-wheat strategy.

## Current Situation
- I have 2 VP (from 2 settlements)
- Resources: 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore
- I need to build more roads to reach strategic locations
- My goal is to focus on upgrading to cities (need 3 ore + 2 wheat per city)

## Road Building Options
Looking at the available actions, I need to decide which road will best advance my strategy:

1. Edge (10, 11): Not clearly beneficial as I already have a settlement at node 11
2. Edge (40, 42): This connects to the ore port, aligning with my current plan
3. Edge (37, 38): Would move toward the wood port
4. Edge (15, 17): Just connects nodes where I already have a settlement
5. Edge (11, 32): Moves toward the wheat port
6. Edge (17, 18): Extends from my settlement but unclear strategic benefit

## Strategic Evaluation
The ore port would be highly valuable for my ore-wheat strategy since:
- I can trade 2 ore for 1 of any resource I need
- This helps optimize resources when I have excess ore
- It aligns with my current plan to build a road to node 42

Building the road to the ore port (option 1) supports my ore-wheat strategy by giving me flexibility when I have excess ore, which is common when pursuing the city-building strategy.

<plan>
1. Build road to node 40 to reach the ore port
2. Roll next turn to collect more resources
3. Use the ore port to optimize my resource conversion
4. Focus on upgrading settlements to cities (need 3 ore + 2 wheat each)
5. Continue working toward largest army
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I will choose action 1 (build a road at edge 40, 42) to connect to the ore port.

# Game Analysis for Turn 29

Let me analyze the current game state and my available options:

## Current Resources
- 1 🐑 SHEEP
- 2 🌾 WHEAT  
- 1 ⛏️ ORE

## Victory Points
- I have 2 VP (from 2 settlements)
- Opponent has 4 VP (2 settlements + longest road bonus)

## Available Actions
- [0] End turn
- [1] Buy a development card (1 🐑, 1 🌾, 1 ⛏️)

## Strategic Analysis

Looking at my current plan, I'm working toward getting to the ore port. However, I don't have resources to build a road this turn (need wood/brick).

I have exactly the resources needed to buy a development card. Development cards provide several benefits:
1. Potential VP card (immediate +1 VP, hidden until win)
2. Knight card (helps get largest army - worth 2 VP)
3. Year of Plenty or Monopoly (resource acquisition)
4. Road Building (free infrastructure)

My current settlements produce wheat, sheep and ore - perfect for the development card strategy. Drawing cards increases my chances of securing largest army (need 3 knights total, already have 1) or getting VP cards.

Red player has 7 cards - they're at risk of losing half on a 7 roll. If I get a knight from this purchase, I can move the robber next turn to potentially disrupt their strategy.

<plan>
1. Buy development card this turn
2. Roll next turn to collect more resources
3. If knight card received, play it to target Red player's best hex
4. Continue working toward largest army (need 2 more knights)
5. Save resources for city upgrades (need 3 ore + 2 wheat each)
6. Build road to ore port when I have wood/brick
</plan>

Given my current resources and the ore-wheat strategy, buying a development card is the optimal move. It could provide a knight (helping toward largest army), a victory point, or a utility card that accelerates my strategy.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Analyzing Game State for Robber Placement

I need to analyze where to place the robber to maximize my advantage while hindering my opponent.

## Game Status Summary
- I'm BLUE with 2 VP (plus 1 hidden VP development card)
- RED has 5 VP (including +2 VP for longest road)
- RED is ahead by 2 VP (considering my hidden VP)
- I have 2 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE
- RED has 4 hidden cards

## Current Production
- RED's city at node 3 produces: 🌲6[⭐⭐⭐], ⛏️9[⭐⭐], 🐑3[⭐]
- RED's settlement at node 13: 🐑3[⭐], 🌾10[⭐], 🧱8[⭐⭐⭐]
- My settlements produce weaker ore than RED's city

## Key Strategic Points
1. The RED player is ahead with 5 VP and has city production already
2. Following the ore-wheat strategy, I should target RED's strong ore production
3. RED gets ore from node 3 on a valuable 9 roll (⭐⭐)
4. RED's city triples their wood production on a strong 6 roll (⭐⭐⭐)

## Robber Placement Options
Looking at my options to maximize impact on RED:

- Option [0]: Block the 6🌲 hex and steal from RED - very strong as this blocks RED's best production (city + ⭐⭐⭐)
- Option [2]: Block the 9⛏️ hex and steal from RED - blocks RED's ore production from their city
- Option [10]: Block RED's 10🌾 hex - blocks one of my own wheat producers too, so not ideal
- Option [11]: Block RED's 8🧱 hex - brick is valuable early game but less crucial in mid-game

Since I'm following the ore-wheat strategy, disrupting RED's ore production is important. However, their wood production from a 6 roll at their city is even more valuable. Blocking high-probability resources at cities provides the best return on robber placement.

<plan>
1. Place robber on RED's 6🌲 hex to block their strongest production (city output)
2. Keep buying development cards when possible to work toward largest army
3. Save resources for city upgrades (need 3 ore + 2 wheat each)
4. Continue building toward ore port when wood/brick available
5. Target securing largest army (need 2 more knights)
</plan>

Option [0] to move the robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED is the optimal choice as it blocks their strongest resource production from their city.

TURN 41 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Place robber on RED's 6🌲 hex to block their strongest production (city output)
2. Keep buying development cards when possible to work toward largest army
3. Save resources for city upgrades (need 3 ore + 2 wheat each)
4. Continue building toward ore port when wood/brick available
5. Target securing largest army (need 2 more knights)

# Game Analysis

Let me assess the current game state and determine the best action for this turn.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 2 VP from my settlements, plus 1 hidden VP card = 3 VP total
- RED has 5 VP (including +2 from Longest Road)
- I have 4 WHEAT and 1 ORE
- I need to prioritize city upgrades (3 ore + 2 wheat per city)
- The robber is on the 🌲6 hex, already blocking RED's best production

## Resource Needs for City Upgrade
- I currently have 1 ORE and 4 WHEAT
- For a city upgrade, I need 3 ORE and 2 WHEAT
- I'm short by 2 ORE, but have excess WHEAT

## Analysis of Available Actions
1. End Turn [0]: This would waste my excess wheat and not advance my strategy.
2. Maritime Trade for BRICK [1]: Not helpful for city strategy.
3. Maritime Trade for ORE [2]: Could give me 1 more ORE, leaving me with 2 ORE total. Still short 1 ORE for a city.
4. Maritime Trade for SHEEP [3]: Not helpful for city strategy.
5. Maritime Trade for WOOD [4]: Not helpful for city strategy.

Trading 4 WHEAT for 1 ORE would bring me closer to having enough for a city upgrade. However, trading at 4:1 is very inefficient. Since I already have 4 WHEAT, keeping them for a future city upgrade makes more sense than trading at this terrible rate.

Given I already have a VP card, continuing to save resources for a city upgrade is my best option. I have 1 ORE and 4 WHEAT, which means I only need 2 more ORE to upgrade one of my settlements to a city.

<plan>
1. End turn and save resources for city upgrade (need 2 more ore)
2. Continue pursuing largest army by buying development cards when possible
3. Consider moving toward ore port (nodes 40, 44) for more efficient ore trading
4. Target upgrading settlement at node 11 to city first (has access to ore production)
</plan>

Since none of the trades are efficient and would set back my city strategy, the best action is to end my turn and continue saving resources.

\boxed{0}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 43 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. End turn and save resources for city upgrade (need 2 more ore)
2. Continue pursuing largest army by buying development cards when possible

# Game Analysis - Settlers of Catan

I'll analyze my current position and the most strategic action for this turn.

## Current Game State Assessment:
- I have 2 VP from my settlements, plus 1 hidden VP from a development card = 3 total VP
- I have 4 wheat and 1 ore in hand
- I've played 1 knight and 2 road building cards 
- Red has 5 VP including the longest road bonus
- My settlements are at nodes 11 (producing ore, wheat) and 17 (producing wheat, sheep)
- My next planned action is to save resources for a city upgrade (need 3 ore, 2 wheat)

## Options Analysis:

1. **End Turn (Action 0)**
   - Pros: Save my resources for future city upgrade (need 2 more ore)
   - Cons: No immediate progress this turn

2. **Trade 4 Wheat for 1 Ore (Action 2)**
   - Pros: Gets me closer to a city upgrade (would have 2 ore, need 1 more)
   - Cons: Inefficient 4:1 trade when I could wait for better rates

3. **Trade for other resources (Actions 1, 3, 4)**
   - These don't align with my ore-wheat strategy and don't help with my immediate city goal

## Decision Logic:
I have 4 wheat and 1 ore. To build a city, I need 3 ore and 2 wheat. I'm only short 2 ore. Trading 4 wheat for 1 ore would bring me to 2 ore, still 1 short of a city, and would leave me with 0 wheat. This isn't efficient.

My settlements have access to ore production (node 11 has two ore hexes). I should save my resources and wait for ore production on my next turn rather than making an inefficient trade.

<plan>
1. End turn and wait for ore production
2. Continue pursuing largest army by buying development cards when excess resources allow
3. Consider moving toward ore port (nodes 40, 44) to enable 2:1 ore trading in the future
4. Target upgrading settlement at node 11 to city first (has access to ore production)
</plan>

The most strategic action is to end my turn and save resources.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current situation carefully:

## Victory Points
- I (BLUE) have 2 VP (2 settlements) + 1 hidden VP card = 3 VP total
- RED has 5 VP (1 settlement + 1 city + Longest Road bonus)

## Resources
- I have 6 WHEAT and 1 ORE
- I need 3 ORE + 2 WHEAT to upgrade a settlement to a city

## Board Position
- My settlement at node 11 produces ORE (albeit on low-probability numbers 3 and 9)
- My settlement at node 17 produces good WHEAT (6 and 11)
- I'm close to the 2:1 ORE port (nodes 40, 44)

## Strategic Considerations

1. **City Upgrade Analysis**: I need 2 more ORE to upgrade a settlement to a city.
   - Current ore production is poor (only 3 and 9 numbers)
   - I can't immediately build a city without trading

2. **Development Card Analysis**: 
   - Costs 1 ORE + 1 WHEAT + 1 SHEEP
   - I don't have SHEEP, so can't buy a development card

3. **Trading Options**:
   - I could trade 4 WHEAT for 1 ORE through the bank (inefficient but provides immediate progress)
   - This would give me 2 ORE total, still need 1 more for a city upgrade

4. **End Turn Consideration**:
   - By ending turn, I preserve resources for next turn's build
   - The robber is on an 11 WHEAT hex (not affecting me directly)
   - I'm at 7 cards total, so no risk of discard

## Decision Analysis

Trading 4 WHEAT for 1 ORE would get me closer to a city, but at a very inefficient rate. Considering my strong ORE-WHEAT strategy, it makes more sense to hold my resources rather than make an inefficient trade.

The most strategic move is to end my turn and wait to accumulate more ORE through production. Since I have 7 cards total (6 WHEAT, 1 ORE), I should end my turn to avoid discarding if a 7 is rolled.

<plan>
1. End turn and accumulate more ORE through production
2. Continue working toward city upgrade at node 11 (needs 2 more ORE)
3. Consider buying development cards if I get SHEEP
4. Long-term goal: extend roads toward ORE port for more efficient ORE trading
5. Focus on largest army as second VP bonus since RED has longest road

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 47 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. End turn and accumulate more ORE through production
2. Continue working toward city upgrade at node 11 (needs 2 more ORE)
3. Consider buying development cards if I get SHEEP
4. Long-term goal: extend roads toward ORE port for more efficient ORE trading
5. Focus on largest army as second VP bonus since RED has longest road

# Game State Analysis

I'll analyze my current situation to determine the best move:

## Victory Point Status
- RED: 5/10 VP (includes +2 for Longest Road)
- BLUE (me): 2/10 VP visible + 1 hidden VP card = 3/10 total

## My Resources
- 7 WHEAT
- 1 ORE
- 1 hidden VICTORY_POINT card

## Strategic Goals Assessment
1. I need 7 more VPs to win
2. My city upgrade plan requires 3 ORE and 2 WHEAT (I need 2 more ORE)
3. I'm at 7 cards - if I don't use them and a 7 is rolled, I'll lose half my resources
4. RED is closer to winning and might be accumulating resources for their next build

## Available Actions Analysis
- Option 0: End turn - Risks losing resources if 7 is rolled
- Option 1-4: Trade 4 WHEAT for another resource
  - Option 2: Trade 4 WHEAT for 1 ORE would give me 2 ORE total

## Decision Logic
The ore-wheat strategy prioritizes city upgrades. I need 2 more ORE to upgrade my settlement at node 11 to a city. Trading 4 WHEAT for 1 ORE brings me closer to this goal. While inefficient (4:1 trade), it:
1. Reduces my hand below 7 cards (avoiding risk from robber)
2. Brings me closer to my city upgrade goal
3. Converts excess WHEAT into needed ORE
4. Follows my strategic plan to prioritize city upgrades

<plan>
1. Trade 4 WHEAT for 1 ORE (brings me to 2 ORE total)
2. Next turn I'll need 1 more ORE to upgrade settlement at node 11 to city
3. Continue focusing on city upgrades as top priority
4. Long-term: work toward ORE port access for more efficient ORE trading
5. Build toward largest army since RED has longest road

The most effective action to advance my ore-wheat strategy is:

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current situation and make the optimal choice for advancing my ore-wheat strategy.

## Current Resources
- 1 SHEEP
- 3 WHEAT
- 3 ORE

## VP Status
- I have 2 visible VP (2 settlements)
- I have 1 hidden VP (from development card)
- My opponent has 5 VP (3 from buildings + 2 from longest road)

## Available Actions
- [0] End turn
- [1] Upgrade settlement at node 11 (Cost: 2 WHEAT, 3 ORE)
- [2] Upgrade settlement at node 17 (Cost: 2 WHEAT, 3 ORE)
- [3] Buy development card (1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE)

## Settlement Analysis
- Node 11 produces: ⛏️9[⭐⭐], ⛏️3[⭐], 🌾10[⭐] - Good ore production
- Node 17 produces: 🌾11[⭐], 🐑8[⭐⭐⭐], 🌾6[⭐⭐⭐] - Excellent wheat production

## Decision Process

I can upgrade either settlement to a city right now, which would:
1. Give me +1 VP (bringing me to 3 visible + 1 hidden = 4 VP)
2. Double the resource production at that settlement

Node 11 primarily produces ore (good probability) and some wheat.
Node 17 primarily produces wheat (excellent probabilities) and sheep.

According to the ore-wheat strategy, I should prioritize cities to double resource production. I need to decide which settlement to upgrade first.

Looking at the probabilities:
- Node 11: Ore on 9 (good), Ore on 3 (poor), Wheat on 10 (decent)
- Node 17: Wheat on 11 (okay), Sheep on 8 (excellent), Wheat on 6 (excellent)

Node 17 has better overall production potential with two high-probability hexes (8 and 6).

In the ore-wheat strategy, doubling the wheat production at node 17 would give me much more wheat for future city upgrades. This would accelerate my ability to build more cities since wheat is used for both cities and development cards.

<plan>
1. Upgrade the settlement at node 17 to a city now
2. Use the doubled wheat production to help get ore for my next city upgrade at node 11
3. Continue focusing on city upgrades as top priority
4. Consider development cards if excess resources become available
5. Work toward largest army since RED has longest road
</plan>

I will upgrade my settlement at node 17 to a city, doubling my wheat production from excellent hexes.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 51 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Upgrade the settlement at node 17 to a city now
2. Use the doubled wheat production to help get ore for my next city upgrade at node 11
3. Continue focusing on city upgrades as top priority
4. Consider development cards if excess resources become available
5. Work toward largest army since RED has longest road
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.
  To adjust your plan, provide a NEW PLAN in your reasoning with <plan>your new plan</plan>

# Game Analysis for Turn 51

I'll analyze the current game situation and determine the optimal action based on the ore-wheat city strategy.

## Current Game State Assessment
- **Victory Points**: I have 3 VP (1 city, 1 settlement, 1 VP card) vs RED's 6 VP (2 cities, longest road)
- **Resources**: I currently have 1 sheep, 2 wheat, 1 ore
- **Buildings**: 1 city (node 17), 1 settlement (node 11)
- **Available Actions**: End turn [0] or Buy development card [1]

## Analysis of Options

**Option 0: End Turn**
- I would save my 1 sheep, 2 wheat, 1 ore for future turns
- Keeping these resources puts me at risk of losing half if a 7 is rolled
- No immediate progress toward victory

**Option 1: Buy Development Card**
- Cost: 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore (which is exactly what I have)
- Potential benefits:
  1. Could be a Victory Point card (immediate +1 VP)
  2. Could be a Knight card (helps toward Largest Army bonus)
  3. Could be a Year of Plenty or Monopoly (helps resource acquisition)
  4. Could be a Road Building card (helps with expansion)
- Aligns with my strategy of potentially working toward largest army

## Strategic Decision Making

Looking at my current plan:
1. The plan to upgrade the settlement at node 17 to a city is already complete
2. I don't have enough resources to build anything substantial
3. There's risk in holding resources until next turn (7 roll)
4. Development cards are a strategic use of excess sheep

Since I have exactly the resources needed for a development card and nothing else I can build this turn, buying a development card is the optimal move. This could either give me another VP card, a knight to help with largest army, or a utility card to help acquire resources for my next city upgrade.

<plan>
1. Buy a development card now with my excess resources
2. Continue focusing on getting ore/wheat for upgrading settlement at node 11 to a city
3. Work toward largest army since RED has longest road
4. Use any resource-producing development cards strategically to accelerate city building
5. Consider expanding to a new settlement location only after upgrading node 11
</plan>

# Game Analysis: Settlers of Catan Turn 53

Let me analyze the current game state and decide on the optimal action.

## Current Status
- I have 3 VP (1 settlement, 1 city, 1 hidden victory point card)
- I have 1 knight card and 1 victory point card
- RED has 6 VP (2 cities + longest road bonus)
- I'm behind by 3 points
- I have NO resources currently
- I need ore and wheat to advance my city-building strategy

## Available Actions
- [0] Play Knight card - Move the robber and steal a resource
- [1] Roll the dice

## Strategic Analysis

Since I have no resources at the moment, and my next turn starts with either rolling or playing a knight, I need to make a careful decision.

If I roll the dice:
- I could get resources naturally based on my settlements/cities
- But the robber is currently on (-2, 1, 1) which is a sheep hex (not directly affecting my production)

If I play the knight:
- I can move the robber to a high-value hex that RED is using
- I can steal a random resource from RED who has 7 cards
- This helps me get one resource immediately before rolling
- This contributes toward largest army (I'd have 2 knights played)
- This prevents RED from potentially getting resources on their highly productive hexes

Looking at RED's cities:
- One city is at node 3, producing from wood 6 (high value), ore 9, sheep 3
- Another city is at node 13, producing from sheep 3, wheat 10, brick 8 (high value)

Playing the knight now to disrupt RED's production and gain a resource seems wise, especially since I have no resources currently. This aligns with my ore-wheat strategy by potentially stealing one of these key resources.

<plan>
1. Play knight card now to disrupt RED and steal a resource
2. Target RED's high-probability production hex (either wood 6 or brick 8)
3. Roll the dice after playing the knight
4. Continue focusing on getting ore/wheat for upgrading settlement at node 11 to a city
5. Keep building toward largest army (need 3 knights total)
</plan>

Given this analysis, my optimal play is to use the knight card now.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 53 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Play knight card now to disrupt RED and steal a resource
2. Target RED's high-probability production hex (either wood 6 or brick 8)
3. Roll the dice after playing the knight
4. Continue focusing on getting ore/wheat for upgrading settlement at node 11 to a city
5. Keep building toward largest army (need 3 knights total)

# Analyzing Robber Placement Options

Let me think step by step about the most strategic robber placement to disrupt RED player while advancing my ore-wheat strategy.

## Current Game State Analysis:
- RED has 6 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + longest road (2 VP)
- I (BLUE) have 3 VP: 1 city (2 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + 1 hidden VP card
- RED has 7 hidden resource cards - they might be saving up for another city or development cards
- My plan focuses on upgrading my settlement at node 11 to a city (need ore and wheat)

## Best Robber Placements to Consider:
1. (0, 0, 0): Wood 6 [⭐⭐⭐] - Blocks RED's city at node 3 which produces Wood 6
2. (-2, 0, 2): Brick 8 [⭐⭐⭐] - Blocks RED's city at node 13 which produces Brick 8
3. (0, -1, 1): Ore 9 [⭐⭐] - Blocks both RED's city at node 3 and my settlement at node 11
4. (-1, -1, 2): Wheat 10 [⭐] - Blocks RED's city at node 13 and my settlement at node 11

I need to prioritize:
- Disrupting RED's high production hexes
- Stealing a potentially useful resource
- Avoiding blocking my own critical resources (ore and wheat especially)

## Decision Analysis:
Option 0 (Wood 6) is an excellent choice because:
- It blocks a 6 (high probability) resource for RED's city
- I don't have any settlements on that hex, so it doesn't hurt my production
- RED has 7 cards, likely including wood from this productive hex
- Taking wood from RED may slow down their road building and expansion

Option 11 (Brick 8) is also strong because:
- It blocks an 8 (high probability) brick resource for RED's city
- I don't have settlements on that hex
- RED may have brick resources I can steal
- This would slow down RED's road building

Option 2 (Ore 9) would block RED but would also block my own settlement at node 11 which produces ore - not ideal since I need ore for city upgrades.

Option 10 (Wheat 10) would block RED but also my own settlement at node 11 which produces wheat - also not ideal.

Between options 0 and 11, option 0 (Wood 6) is slightly better because:
- 6 is a higher probability number than 8
- RED's city at node 3 produces three resources including this wood, making it their most productive city

<plan>
1. Place robber on Wood 6 hex (0,0,0) to disrupt RED's high-probability production
2. Steal a resource from RED, hoping for ore or wheat
3. Continue focusing on getting ore/wheat for upgrading settlement at node 11 to a city
4. Consider buying development cards if I get sheep to work toward largest army
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I'll place the robber on the Wood 6 hex.

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Place robber on Wood 6 hex (0,0,0) to disrupt RED's high-probability production
2. Steal a resource from RED, hoping for ore or wheat
3. Continue focusing on getting ore/wheat for upgrading settlement at node 11 to a city
4. Consider buying development cards if I get sheep to work toward largest army

# Game Analysis for Turn 59

Let me carefully analyze the current game state and determine the best action for our ore-wheat strategy.

## Current Game Status
- BLUE (me): 3 VP + 1 hidden VP card = 4 VP
- RED: 6 VP (including 2 VP from Longest Road)
- I have: 6 WHEAT, 2 ORE
- RED has 4 unknown resource cards

## Goals Assessment
- I need 6 more VP to win
- I have a settlement at node 11 that needs upgrading to a city (need 3 ORE, 2 WHEAT)
- I have 2 ORE already, so I need 1 more ORE for the city upgrade

## Options Analysis

1. **End Turn (Action 0)**
   - I'd gain nothing this turn
   - I can hope to roll better next turn
   - Risk holding 8 cards (6 wheat + 2 ore) if I roll a 7

2. **Maritime Trade Options**
   - Trade 4 WHEAT for 1 ORE (Action 2)
     - This would give me 3 ORE + 2 WHEAT, exactly what I need for a city upgrade
     - City upgrade is our core strategy (doubles resource production)
     - I'd have 2 ORE + 2 WHEAT remaining after the trade and city build
   - Other maritime trades (Actions 1, 3, 4) don't help with my immediate city goal

## Strategic Decision

The most efficient action is to trade 4 WHEAT for 1 ORE. This will allow me to upgrade the settlement at node 11 to a city immediately this turn. This aligns perfectly with our ore-wheat strategy which prioritizes city upgrades.

After this trade, I'll have 3 ORE and 2 WHEAT total, which is exactly what I need for the city upgrade. This will move me to 5 VP and increase my ore production.

<plan>
1. Trade 4 WHEAT for 1 ORE using maritime trade
2. Upgrade settlement at node 11 to city (will have exactly 3 ORE, 2 WHEAT required)
3. Continue focusing on development cards to work toward largest army
4. Next expansion target should be securing better ore production
</plan>

\boxed{2}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

❓ Select action by number (0-1):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the game state and determine the optimal action based on the ore-wheat strategy.

Current situation:
- I have 3 VP (1 settlement, 1 city, 1 VP card)
- I have 2 WHEAT and 3 ORE
- I've played 2 knights (need 1 more for largest army)
- Red has 6 VP (2 cities, longest road)

Available actions:
- [0] End turn
- [1] Upgrade settlement at node 11 to city (Cost: 2 WHEAT, 3 ORE)

Analysis:
1. I have exactly the resources needed to upgrade my settlement at node 11 to a city
2. This would increase my VP from 3 to 4
3. It would also double my production at that node, which produces:
   - ORE (9) - high probability
   - ORE (3) - low probability
   - WHEAT (10) - good probability

This is absolutely the right move because:
- It follows the ore-wheat strategy by upgrading to a city
- It increases my victory points
- It doubles my ore production, which is critical for the strategy
- The settlement is on high-value ore and wheat hexes

The city upgrade will significantly improve my resource generation, especially for ore, which is crucial for my continued strategy of buying development cards and building more cities. This fits perfectly with my plan to focus on city upgrades.

<plan>
1. Upgrade settlement at node 11 to city (immediately)
2. Continue focusing on development cards to work toward largest army (need 1 more knight)
3. Next expansion target should be securing better ore production
4. Build toward 3 cities total (currently will have 2) + largest army for victory
</plan>

# Game State Analysis

Let me carefully analyze the current game state to make the optimal robber placement decision.

## Current Game Situation
- I have 4 VP (2 cities) + 1 hidden VP card = 5 VP
- RED has 6 VP (2 cities + longest road bonus)
- I need 5 more VP to win
- RED has 3 hidden resource cards
- I have 4 wheat and 2 ore
- I need 1 more knight to get largest army (2 VP)

## Strategic Priorities
1. Block RED's highest-value resource production
2. Potentially steal a valuable resource from RED
3. Avoid disrupting my own resource production

## Robber Placement Options Analysis

Looking at RED's cities:
- City at node 3 produces: 🌲6[⭐⭐⭐], ⛏️9[⭐⭐], 🐑3[⭐]
- City at node 13 produces: 🐑3[⭐], 🌾10[⭐], 🧱8[⭐⭐⭐]

The most valuable hexes for RED are:
- Wood (6) with 3 pips - this is currently blocked by the robber
- Brick (8) with 3 pips
- Ore (9) with 2 pips

But I need to be careful because I also have a city at node 11 that produces from the Ore (9) hex. Blocking that would hurt me too.

Since the robber is already on the Wood (6) hex which is RED's highest-value production, I should focus on their next highest value - the Brick (8) hex at (-2, 0, 2). This hex is connected to RED's city at node 13 but not to any of my settlements/cities.

Also, since RED only has 3 cards, there's a decent chance of stealing something useful, while disrupting their 3-pip production of brick.

<plan>
1. Move robber to Brick (8) hex to block RED's high-value production
2. Continue gathering resources for another development card (hoping for knight)
3. Work toward largest army (need 1 more knight)
4. Next expansion should target better ore production
5. Build toward 3 cities total for victory
</plan>

Therefore, I'll choose option 10: Move robber to (-2, 0, 2) and steal from RED.

\boxed{10}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 63 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Move robber to Brick (8) hex to block RED's high-value production
2. Continue gathering resources for another development card (hoping for knight)
3. Work toward largest army (need 1 more knight)
4. Next expansion should target better ore production
5. Build toward 3 cities total for victory
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.
  To adjust your plan, provide a NEW PLAN in your reasoning with <plan>your new plan</plan>

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

I need to carefully analyze my current situation and determine the optimal action to advance my ore-wheat strategy.

## Current Game State Assessment:
- I have 4 VP (2 cities)
- RED has 6 VP (2 cities + longest road bonus)
- I have 4 WHEAT and 3 ORE in hand
- I have 1 VICTORY_POINT development card
- I've played 2 KNIGHT cards (I need 1 more to get largest army)
- The robber is on RED's brick hex (8), which was a good strategic move

## Resource Analysis:
With 4 WHEAT and 3 ORE, I'm in a position to:
- Buy a development card (costs 1 ORE, 1 WHEAT, 1 SHEEP) - but I lack SHEEP
- Build a city (costs 3 ORE, 2 WHEAT) - I have just enough resources
- Build a settlement (costs 1 BRICK, 1 WOOD, 1 WHEAT, 1 SHEEP) - I lack resources

## Strategic Options:
1. End my turn and collect more resources
2. Trade WHEAT for another resource
3. Buy a development card (can't - no SHEEP)
4. Upgrade to city (can't - no valid settlement to upgrade)
5. Build a settlement (can't - lack needed resources)

## Decision Reasoning:
I have enough WHEAT and ORE for a city, but I don't have any settlements to upgrade. I need to save my resources for either:
1. A development card (hoping for a Knight to get largest army)
2. Building a settlement in a strategic location
3. Building another city eventually

My current situation doesn't give me an immediate beneficial building or buying opportunity, and trading my valuable WHEAT for anything other than SHEEP (to enable development card purchase) isn't aligned with the ore-wheat strategy.

Given that I don't have enough resources to make progress this turn through building or development card purchase, the most effective action is to end my turn and collect more resources next round. Trading WHEAT at 4:1 ratio is inefficient and I would be trading away a critical resource.

<plan>
1. End turn to collect more resources
2. Next turn, focus on acquiring SHEEP to buy a development card (hoping for knight)
3. Work toward largest army (need 1 more knight)
4. Consider settlement expansion to secure better resource diversity
5. Aim for 3 cities total for victory
</plan>

# Game Analysis for Blue Player

## Current Game State
- I have 4 VP (2 cities, 1 hidden VP card)
- Red has 6 VP (2 cities + longest road bonus)
- My resources: 2 🐑SHEEP, 4 🌾WHEAT, 5 ⛏️ORE
- I've played 2 knights already (need 1 more for largest army)
- Red has longest road with 8 segments (I have 4)

## Strategic Assessment
Red is at 6 VP, and I'm at 4 VP (plus 1 hidden). I need to focus on getting to 10 VP. My cities are producing well, especially with the high-value wheat (6, 11) and sheep (8) hexes.

The fastest path to victory would be:
- Get largest army (+2 VP) - need 1 more knight
- Build a settlement (+1 VP)
- Use my hidden VP card (+1 VP)
- Build another settlement or city upgrade (+1 VP)

## Action Analysis
Looking at the available actions:
1. Buy a development card (costs 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE): This is my best option. I have enough resources and there's a good chance to get a knight for largest army.

2-9. Various maritime trades: These are inefficient and unnecessary right now. I don't need to trade my valuable ore/wheat for other resources.

0. End turn: This doesn't progress my strategy.

## Decision
The optimal action is to buy a development card. This aligns with the ore-wheat strategy by:
1. Potentially getting a knight to secure largest army (+2 VP)
2. Possibility of drawing another VP card
3. Efficiently using my resources
4. Maintaining hidden strategy until I can win in one move

<plan>
1. Buy development card now, hoping for a knight or VP card
2. If I get a knight, play it next turn to secure largest army
3. Focus on building settlements next to expand production
4. Continue upgrading to cities when possible
5. Aim for victory through city upgrades + largest army + VP cards
</plan>

\boxed{1}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Buy development card now, hoping for a knight or VP card
2. If I get a knight, play it next turn to secure largest army

# Game Analysis for Turn 65

I'll analyze my position as the BLUE player and determine the optimal move for my ore-wheat strategy.

## Current Position Assessment:
- I have 4VP (2 cities, each worth 2VP) + 1 hidden VP card = 5VP total
- Resources: 1 🐑SHEEP, 3 🌾WHEAT, 4 ⛏️ORE
- Development cards: 1 YEAR_OF_PLENTY and 1 VICTORY_POINT
- RED has 6VP (2 cities + longest road)
- I have 2 knights played, need 1 more for largest army

## Victory Path Assessment:
To reach 10VP, I could aim for:
- Current 4VP + 1 hidden VP + largest army (2VP) + 3 more VP (from cities/settlements/cards)

## Available Actions:
1. Buy development card (1 🐑, 1 🌾, 1 ⛏️)
2-5. Various maritime trades (none are immediately beneficial)
0. End turn

## Decision Analysis:
Buying a development card is clearly the best option here. I have exactly the resources needed (1 🐑, 1 🌾, 1 ⛏️). 

If I draw:
- KNIGHT: I can play it next turn to secure largest army (2VP), bringing me to 7VP total
- VICTORY_POINT: Adds 1 hidden VP, bringing me to 6VP total
- MONOPOLY: Could be valuable later for a critical resource
- YEAR_OF_PLENTY: Can help get specific resources I need
- ROAD_BUILDING: Less valuable but still helps expansion

With my remaining resources (2 🌾, 3 ⛏️), I'll be close to building a city next turn if I get the right resources from production.

<plan>
1. Buy development card now, hoping for a knight or VP card
2. If I get a knight, play it next turn to secure largest army (2VP)
3. Save my current Year of Plenty card for when I need specific resources
4. Continue the ore-wheat strategy to build more cities
5. Path to victory: Current 5VP + largest army (2VP) + city upgrade (2VP) + existing VP card (1VP) = 10VP
</plan>

The best move is to buy a development card, which gives me a chance at a knight to secure largest army or another VP card.

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze the current state of the game and determine the best action:

## Current Status
- I have 4 VP (2 cities = 4 VP)
- I have 1 hidden VP card
- Resources: 2 wheat, 5 ore
- Development cards: 1 Knight, 1 Year of Plenty, 1 Victory Point
- Already played: 2 Knights, 2 Road Building
- Red has 6 VP (2 cities = 4 VP + Longest Road = 2 VP)

## Path to Victory Analysis
Currently I need 6 more VP to win. My possible sources:
- Play my hidden VP card (+1 VP)
- Largest Army (need one more knight to play to get +2 VP)
- Build more cities (+2 VP each)
- Build settlements (+1 VP each)

## Action Options
1. **Roll the dice**: Safe option but delays my strategic moves
2. **Play Knight card**: This would give me Largest Army (+2 VP) and let me steal a resource
3. **Play Year of Plenty**: Could get specific resources I need

## Decision Logic
Playing the Knight card is the most strategic move because:
1. It immediately secures Largest Army (2 VP)
2. I'd move to 4 VP + 2 VP (Largest Army) + 1 VP (hidden card) = 7 VP
3. I could move the robber from the brick hex to target a more valuable hex
4. I could potentially steal a valuable resource from Red

Playing the Knight now has the highest immediate VP gain and positions me strongly for future turns where I can use my Year of Plenty and 5 ore + 2 wheat to continue building toward victory.

<plan>
1. Play Knight now to secure Largest Army (2VP)
2. Move robber to high-value hex affecting Red player
3. Next turn, use my 5 ore + 2 wheat + Year of Plenty to build a city or settlement
4. Path to victory: Current 4VP + largest army (2VP) + hidden VP card (1VP) + future city (2VP) = 9VP, then one more settlement to win
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I choose to play my Knight card:

\boxed{15}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 67 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Play Knight now to secure Largest Army (2VP)
2. Move robber to high-value hex affecting Red player
3. Next turn, use my 5 ore + 2 wheat + Year of Plenty to build a city or settlement
4. Path to victory: Current 4VP + largest army (2VP) + hidden VP card (1VP) + future city (2VP) = 9VP, then one more settlement to win

# Settlers of Catan: Robber Move Analysis

I need to decide where to place the robber to maximize my chances of winning through the ore-wheat strategy.

## Game Analysis
- I have 6 VP currently (2 cities + largest army)
- Red has 6 VP (2 cities + longest road)
- I have 2 wheat, 5 ore, a Year of Plenty card, and a Victory Point card (1 hidden VP)
- My path to victory: I need 3 more VP (city+settlement or 3 settlements)

## Robber Placement Priorities:
1. Block Red's highest value production
2. Target resources I need (especially wheat)
3. Make sure I can steal a card from Red

Let me examine Red's city production:
- Node 3: 🌲6[⭐⭐⭐], ⛏️9[⭐⭐], 🐑3[⭐] - Wood(6) is high value
- Node 13: 🐑3[⭐], 🌾10[⭐], 🧱8[⭐⭐⭐] - Brick(8) is high value

Looking at the possible robber moves with the highest impact:
- [0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) - Wood(6) hex that Red's city on node 3 produces
- [2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) - Ore(9) hex that Red's city on node 3 produces
- [10] Move robber to (-1, -1, 2) - Wheat(10) hex that affects both Red's city on node 13 and my city on node 11

For my ore-wheat strategy, I want to prioritize blocking Red while protecting my own wheat and ore production.

Option [0] blocks Red's valuable wood(6) production which helps prevent Red from building roads to extend their longest road.

Option [2] blocks Red's ore(9) production which could hinder their city development.

Option [10] blocks wheat(10) which affects both of us, but I already have 2 wheat and will get the Year of Plenty card to get more resources if needed.

Given my ore-wheat focus, blocking Red's ore(9) with option [2] makes the most strategic sense, as it prevents them from upgrading to cities while preserving all my production.

<plan>
1. Move robber to ore(9) hex to block Red's ore production
2. Use my 5 ore + 2 wheat + Year of Plenty next turn to build a city (if I can get more ore/wheat)
3. Keep pushing for largest army advantage while building toward 10 VP
4. Path to victory: Current 6VP (visible) + hidden VP card (1VP) + future city (2VP) + future settlement (1VP) = 10VP
</plan>

You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 67 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Move robber to ore(9) hex to block Red's ore production
2. Use my 5 ore + 2 wheat + Year of Plenty next turn to build a city (if I can get more ore/wheat)
3. Keep pushing for largest army advantage while building toward 10 VP
4. Path to victory: Current 6VP (visible) + hidden VP card (1VP) + future city (2VP) + future settlement (1VP) = 10VP

# Game Analysis for Blue Player

Let me analyze the current game state and determine the best action:

## Current Situation Assessment
- I have 6 VP (2 cities = 4 VP, Largest Army = 2 VP)
- I have 1 hidden VP card = 1 VP
- Resources: 2 wheat, 8 ore
- Dev cards: 1 Year of Plenty, 1 VP card
- Red has 6 VP (2 cities = 4 VP, Longest Road = 2 VP)
- Red has 8 hidden resource cards
- The robber is currently on the 9 ore hex which blocks my city production

## Available Actions
0. End turn
1-4. Trade 4 ore for sheep/wood/brick/wheat respectively

## Strategic Analysis

My current resources don't allow me to build anything significant:
- City: Need 3 ore + 2 wheat (have 8 ore + 2 wheat, but already maxed out cities)
- Settlement: Need 1 wood + 1 brick + 1 wheat + 1 sheep (missing wood, brick, sheep)
- Development card: Need 1 ore + 1 wheat + 1 sheep (missing sheep)
- Road: Need 1 wood + 1 brick (missing wood and brick)

With 8 ore, I could trade for resources I need. Trading 4 ore for 1 wheat would give me 3 wheat, but I can't immediately build anything with that. Similarly, trading for sheep, wood, or brick alone won't enable any immediate builds.

Next turn I could use Year of Plenty to get specific resources. If I save my current resources, on my next turn I could potentially:
1. Use Year of Plenty to get wood + brick
2. Build a road to a good settlement location
3. Build a settlement (if I also get a sheep)

<plan>
1. End my turn to preserve resources and avoid depletion
2. Next turn, use Year of Plenty to get wood + brick or sheep + wood/brick
3. Build a settlement at a strategic location
4. Path to victory: Current 6VP + hidden VP (1VP) + settlement (1VP) + dev card(s) for additional 2VP = 10VP
</plan>

Since I can't make immediate progress this turn and my ore production is currently blocked by the robber, the most strategic move is to end my turn and prepare for my next move with Year of Plenty.

\boxed{0}

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build

# Game Analysis and Strategic Planning

Let me analyze the current game state and the available actions:

## Current Situation
- I have 6 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + Largest Army (2 VP) + Hidden VP Card (1 VP)
- Resources: 1 WHEAT, 3 ORE
- Development Cards: 1 YEAR_OF_PLENTY, 1 VICTORY_POINT
- Red has 6 VP and longest road

## Available Actions
I can either roll the dice or play Year of Plenty to get two resources of my choice.

## Strategic Considerations
1. **Path to Victory**: I need 3 more VP to win (currently at 6+1 hidden). Most direct path is building at least one settlement (1 VP) plus buying/using VP development cards (2 VP).
2. **Resource Needs**: To build a settlement, I need 1 BRICK + 1 WOOD + 1 SHEEP + 1 WHEAT.
3. **Current Resources**: I have 1 WHEAT + 3 ORE, so I'm missing BRICK, WOOD, and SHEEP for a settlement.

## Year of Plenty Options Analysis
Looking at my options for Year of Plenty, I need to maximize progress toward my victory condition:

- I currently have WHEAT and ORE, so getting WOOD+BRICK or WOOD+SHEEP would be most useful for a settlement.
- Option [12] gives me WOOD+BRICK, which combined with my WHEAT would just need SHEEP to build a settlement.
- Option [4] gives me WOOD+SHEEP, which combined with my WHEAT would just need BRICK to build a settlement.

## Decision Logic
Option [12] (WOOD+BRICK) seems strategically superior because:
1. It provides two of the four resources needed for a settlement
2. It complements my existing WHEAT resource
3. I'd only need SHEEP to build a settlement next turn
4. Since I'm far from having enough resources to build a city (5 resources needed), focusing on settlement seems right

<plan>
1. Use Year of Plenty to get WOOD+BRICK
2. Next turn, aim to get SHEEP to build a settlement
3. Continue purchasing development cards with excess ORE+WHEAT to find Victory Point cards
4. Path to victory: Current 6VP + hidden VP (1VP) + settlement (1VP) + 2 more VP from dev cards = 10VP
</plan>

Therefore, I choose to play Year of Plenty for WOOD and BRICK.

2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 69 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Use Year of Plenty to get WOOD+BRICK
2. Next turn, aim to get SHEEP to build a settlement
3. Continue purchasing development cards with excess ORE+WHEAT to find Victory Point cards
4. Path to victory: Current 6VP + hidden VP (1VP) + settlement (1VP) + 2 more VP from dev cards = 10VP
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis: Turn 69

I'll analyze my current position and available actions to determine the optimal move.

## Current Game State
- I have 6 VP (2 cities + largest army)
- I have 1 hidden VP card (7 VP total)
- Resources: 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat, 5 ore
- Need 3 more VP to win

## Resource Production
- My cities are well positioned, producing ore and wheat effectively
- Red has strong wood and brick production

## Available Options Analysis:

1. **Build a Road (Actions 1-7)**
   - I have exactly enough resources (1 wood, 1 brick) to build one road
   - Building a road now would use all my wood and brick
   - Road building doesn't directly contribute to victory points unless I can get longest road
   - Red already has 8 road segments, I only have 4, so longest road is likely out of reach

2. **Maritime Trade (Actions 8-11)**
   - Could trade 4 ore for sheep, wood, brick, or wheat
   - Ore is valuable for cities/development cards, trading at 4:1 is inefficient
   - Don't need to trade wheat since I already have one

3. **End Turn (Action 0)**
   - Preserves my current resources
   - I need sheep to buy development cards (looking for VP cards)
   - I already have wood+brick which are needed for settlement building

## Path to Victory Assessment:
- Current: 6 VP visible + 1 hidden VP = 7 VP
- Need 3 more VP
- Options:
  1. Build a settlement (1 VP) + find 2 more VP cards
  2. Find 3 more VP cards

<plan>
1. End turn now to preserve resources
2. Use wood+brick to build settlement when I get sheep
3. Continue purchasing development cards with excess ore+wheat to find more VP cards
4. Path to victory: Current 7VP (including hidden) + settlement (1VP) + 2 more VP from dev cards = 10VP
</plan>

Building a road now would commit my wood and brick without a clear benefit since I can't immediately build a settlement (need sheep). I should save these valuable resources for when I can actually build a settlement.

The maritime trades are inefficient and unnecessary at this time. My best move is to end my turn, preserve my resources, and work toward buying more development cards on future turns when I get more resources.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

# Analyzing the Game State and Robber Move Options

I need to decide where to place the robber to maximize my chances of winning with the ore-wheat strategy. Let's analyze the current game state and robber placement options.

## Current Game State Analysis:
- I have 6 visible VP plus 1 hidden VP card = 7 VP total (need 3 more to win)
- Resources: 1 brick, 1 wheat, 3 ore
- Red player has 7 VP (including longest road)
- I have largest army (3 knights played)
- I need to block Red's best production and possibly steal valuable resources

## Robber Placement Analysis:

The most strategic options:

1. Option [0]: Block the wood hex (0,0,0) with 6 pips
   - This is a high-value hex (6 is high probability)
   - RED has a city adjacent to this hex (at node 3)
   - This would significantly reduce RED's wood production
   - Could steal from RED

2. Option [10]: Block hex (-2,0,2) with brick-8 (5 pips)
   - RED has a city there (at node 13)
   - This is RED's best brick production
   - Could steal from RED

3. Option [4]: Block wood-9 hex (0,1,-1) with 4 pips
   - RED has a settlement adjacent to this hex (at node 0)
   - Would reduce RED's wood production further
   - Could steal from RED

Since I'm following the ore-wheat strategy, I should mainly:
1. Block RED's best production to slow them down
2. Prioritize blocking resources that help RED build roads (brick/wood)
3. Possibly gain a needed resource through stealing

RED already has longest road, and they have multiple wood-producing hexes. Their city at node 3 produces from the 6-wood hex, which is their most valuable production. Blocking this would significantly hamper their expansion capabilities.

## Decision:

I'll place the robber on the wood-6 hex at (0,0,0). This is a high-probability hex (6 pips) that RED's city is adjacent to. This will significantly slow down RED's wood production, which is crucial for their road-building strategy, and I can steal a card from them.

<plan>
1. Block RED's wood production with robber

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and determine the best action:

## Current Situation
- I have 6 visible VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
- I have 1 hidden VP from a development card
- Total: 7 VP out of 10 needed to win
- Resources: 1 brick, 1 wheat, 4 ore
- RED has 7 VP (5 visible + 2 for longest road)

## Available Actions
- [0] End turn
- [1-4] Maritime trade options (trading 4 ore for other resources)

## Goal Assessment
Looking at my current resources (1 brick, 1 wheat, 4 ore), I don't have enough to build anything useful:
- Settlement: Need 1 brick, 1 wood, 1 wheat, 1 sheep (missing wood and sheep)
- City upgrade: Need 3 ore, 2 wheat (I have 4 ore but only 1 wheat)
- Development card: Need 1 ore, 1 wheat, 1 sheep (missing sheep)

Since I don't have good immediate build options, I should consider if trading makes sense.

## Trade Analysis
I could trade 4 ore for either sheep, wood, brick, or wheat. With my remaining resources, I'd have:
1. 4 ore → 1 sheep: Would have 1 brick, 1 wheat, 0 ore, 1 sheep (still missing wood for settlement)
2. 4 ore → 1 wood: Would have 1 brick, 1 wheat, 0 ore, 1 wood (still missing sheep for settlement)
3. 4 ore → 1 brick: Would have 2 brick, 1 wheat, 0 ore (not useful)
4. 4 ore → 1 wheat: Would have 1 brick, 2 wheat, 0 ore (not useful)

None of these trades would allow me to build anything useful this turn. Ore is also my most valuable resource for future city upgrades, and I'd be getting a poor trade ratio (4:1).

## Strategic Plan Review
My current plan mentions:
1. Blocking RED's wood production with robber - can't do this now as I'm not rolling dice
2. Saving resources for my next settlement
3. Buying development cards with excess resources
4. Path to victory includes getting another settlement (1 VP) and 2 more VP from dev cards

<plan>
1. Save resources until I can build effectively
2. Target a settlement at a high-value location to secure more production
3. Continue buying development cards when I have the resources
4. Path to victory: Current 7VP (including hidden) + settlement (1VP) + 2 more VP from dev cards = 10VP
</plan>

## Decision
Given that none of the trades would enable me to build anything useful this turn, and trading away ore at a 4:1 ratio is inefficient, the best option is to end my turn and wait for better resource production next round.

# Game Analysis for Blue

I'll analyze the current game state and determine the best action.

## Current status
- I have 6 visible VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + Largest Army (2 VP)
- I have 1 hidden Victory Point card = 7 total VP
- Resources: 1 brick, 1 wheat, 4 ore
- Red has 7 VP with Longest Road bonus

## Resource and Production Analysis
My production is strong in:
- Wheat (from both cities - 11 and 6)
- Ore (from city at node 11)
- Sheep (from city at node 17)

## Action Options
1. End turn (action 0)
2. Maritime trades (actions 1-4)

Since I have 4 ore, I could trade it for another resource. But what would be most valuable?

## Strategic Considerations
With 7 VP (including my hidden VP card), I need 3 more VP to win. Options:
- Building settlements (+1 VP each)
- Buying development cards (chance for VP cards or knights)

Looking at my resources (1 brick, 1 wheat, 4 ore), I'm very close to having enough for a development card (1 ore + 1 wheat + 1 sheep). Getting a sheep would allow me to buy a development card, which could be:
- A VP card (immediate progress toward victory)
- A knight (strengthening my Largest Army lead)
- A Road Building or Year of Plenty card (utility)

<plan>
1. Trade 4 ore for 1 sheep
2. Use 1 ore + 1 wheat + 1 sheep to buy a development card
3. Continue buying development cards for potential VP cards
4. Consider settlement placement if I gather enough resources
5. Path to victory: Current 7VP + 3 more VP from dev cards/settlements = 10VP
</plan>

Comparing the options, the maritime trade for a sheep (action 1) is clearly the optimal choice. This will let me buy a development card this turn, potentially moving me closer to victory.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 75 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Trade 4 ore for 1 sheep
2. Use 1 ore + 1 wheat + 1 sheep to buy a development card
3. Continue buying development cards for potential VP cards
4. Consider settlement placement if I gather enough resources
5. Path to victory: Current 7VP + 3 more VP from dev cards/settlements = 10VP
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze the current game state:

## Game Status Overview
- I have 6 Victory Points: 2 Cities (4 VP) + Largest Army (2 VP)
- I have 1 hidden Victory Point card
- So my actual VP count is 7/10
- RED has 7 VP: 2 Cities (4 VP) + 1 Settlement (1 VP) + Longest Road (2 VP)
- I need 3 more VP to win

## Resources Analysis
- I have: 1 🧱BRICK, 3 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 2 ⛏️ORE
- This allows me to buy a development card (costs 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE)
- I cannot build any settlements (need 1 brick + 1 wood + 1 wheat + 1 sheep)
- I cannot upgrade to a city (need 3 ore + 2 wheat)

## Strategic Considerations
1. RED player is at 7 VP and ahead of me
2. Buying a development card gives me a chance at:
   - Victory Point card (direct +1 VP)
   - Knight card (helps maintain Largest Army)
   - Year of Plenty or Monopoly (helps gather resources faster)
   - Road Building (helps expand)
3. I already have good ore and wheat production from my cities
4. I need to maintain my Largest Army bonus (2 VP)

## Decision Making
Following my ore-wheat strategy, buying a development card is my best option because:
1. It might be a Victory Point card (bringing me to 8 VP)
2. It might be a Knight to protect my Largest Army bonus
3. It maintains my hidden VP strategy
4. My cities are already producing good ore and wheat, so I'll be able to make progress next turn

<plan>
1. Buy a development card this turn
2. Continue focusing on development cards for potential VP cards
3. Save resources for a city upgrade when possible
4. Path to victory: Current 7VP (including hidden) + 3 more VP from dev cards = 10VP
</plan>

RESPONSE:
# Game Analysis and Move Selection

Let me analyze this Settlers of Catan position where I need to move the robber as BLUE player.

## Victory Point Status
- BLUE (me): 6 visible VP + 2 hidden VP cards = 8 VP total
- RED: 7 visible VP (including +2 from longest road)
- I need 2 more VP to win, which I can potentially get from development cards

## Current Game State Assessment
- The robber is currently on the Wood (6) hex at (0,0,0), which is a high-probability hex
- RED has a city at node 3 that produces from this hex, so RED is currently blocked
- I have 1 Brick, 2 Sheep, 2 Wheat, and 1 Ore - not enough for a city, but enough for a development card

## Strategic Priorities
1. Block RED's high-producing hexes
2. Potentially steal a valuable resource from RED
3. Protect my own high-value production
4. Set up for my next turn where I plan to buy a development card

## Robber Placement Analysis
The best options are:
- Option [1]: Place on Ore (9) hex at (0,-1,1) - This blocks RED's city at node 3 which produces from this high-probability Ore hex. Ore is crucial for both players.
- Option [9]: Place on Wheat (10) hex at (-1,-1,2) - This blocks RED's city at node 13 from a high-probability Wheat hex.
- Option [10]: Place on Brick (8) hex at (-2,0,2) - This blocks RED's city at node 13 from a high-probability Brick hex.

## Decision Making
Option [1] is strategically strongest because:
1. It blocks RED from a valuable Ore (9) hex - ore is critical for city building
2. It affects RED's city at node 3 which has multiple high-value productions
3. I have a chance to steal from RED, potentially getting ore which I need
4. It aligns with the ore-wheat strategy by denying RED access to ore

<plan>
1. Move robber to block RED's Ore (9) production
2. Buy a development card next turn
3. Continue focusing on development cards for potential VP cards
4. Save resources for a city upgrade when possible
5. Path to victory: Current 8VP (including hidden VP cards) + 2 more VP from dev cards = 10VP
</plan>

After careful consideration of all options, I choose to move the robber to the Ore (9) hex at (0,-1,1) and steal from RED:

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 77 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Move robber to block RED's Ore (9) production
2. Buy a development card next turn

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze my current game state and options:

## Current Status
- I have 6 visible VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + Largest Army (2 VP)
- I have 2 hidden VP from development cards
- Total: 8 VP (need 2 more to win)
- Resources: 2 🧱BRICK, 2 🐑SHEEP, 2 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE
- I have the Largest Army with 3 knights played

## Opponent Status
- RED has 7 VP: 1 settlement (1 VP) + 2 cities (4 VP) + Longest Road (2 VP)
- RED is only 3 VP away from winning

## Available Actions
- [0] End turn
- [1] Buy a development card (costs 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE)

## Strategic Analysis

Buying a development card is extremely valuable right now:
1. I already have 8 VP (including 2 hidden VP cards)
2. There's a chance to draw another VP card, giving me 9 VP
3. Or I could draw a Knight, Road Building, Year of Plenty, or Monopoly - all useful
4. With 17 dev cards remaining, my chances of drawing useful cards are high

If I end my turn without buying a development card, I'm wasting resources that could help me win faster.

<plan>
1. Buy development cards aggressively to find the remaining VP cards needed for victory
2. Save resources for additional dev cards on future turns
3. Path to victory: Current 8VP (including hidden VP) + 2 more VP from dev cards = 10VP win
</plan>

Given my current ore-wheat strategy and my proximity to winning (need just 2 more VP), buying the development card is clearly the optimal move.

❓ Select action by number (0-1):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I need to analyze the current game state and determine the best action for maximizing my chances of winning.

First, let me assess my position and resources:
- I have 6 visible VP (2 cities = 4 VP + Largest Army = 2 VP)
- I have 2 hidden VP cards in my hand
- Total VP = 8/10, so I need 2 more VP to win
- I have 2 🧱BRICK, 1 🐑SHEEP, 3 🌾WHEAT
- I also have 1 Knight development card in my hand

The robber is currently on (0, -1, 1), which is a hex with ore and a probability of 9. This is actually blocking one of my cities at node 11, which produces ore from this hex.

Let me consider my options:

Option 0: Play Knight card
- This would allow me to move the robber away from my ore-producing hex
- I could potentially steal a resource from RED
- I would maintain my Largest Army bonus
- This would unblock my ore production at node 11, which is critical for my ore-wheat strategy

Option 1: Roll the dice
- If I roll, I might get resources, but my ore production is currently blocked
- I won't get any immediate benefit from unblocking my ore hex
- I'm risking a 7 roll that could make me discard cards if I have more than 7

Looking at my current plan:
My plan is to buy development cards aggressively to find the remaining VP cards. I have 8 VP total (including hidden VP), so I need 2 more VP to win. These would need to come from development cards since I don't have enough resources to build settlements/cities and I don't have longest road.

Decision analysis:
Moving the robber off my ore hex is critical to my strategy. I need ore production to buy development cards. Additionally, playing the Knight reinforces my control of Largest Army (now at 4 knights). I could potentially steal a valuable resource from RED as well.

<plan>
1. Play Knight to unblock my ore-producing hex
2. Move the robber to a high-value hex that RED is using (likely the 8 brick or 6 wood)
3. Steal a resource from RED
4. Continue saving for development cards on future turns
5. Path to victory: Current 8VP (including 2 hidden VP) + 2 more VP from dev cards = 10VP win
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I should play the Knight card to unblock my ore production, which is crucial for my ore-wheat strategy to buy development cards.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Robber Placement

I need to place the robber strategically to maximize my chances of winning. Let me analyze the situation:

## Current Game State
- My VP: 6 visible + 2 hidden = 8/10 VP
- Red's VP: 7/10 VP (including 2 VP from longest road)
- Red is only 3 VP away from winning, so they're the clear target
- I just played a Knight card, which is why I'm moving the robber

## Analyzing Red's Production
Red's settlements/cities produce:
- 🏙️ at node 3: 🌲6[⭐⭐⭐], ⛏️9[⭐⭐], 🐑3[⭐]
- 🏙️ at node 13: 🐑3[⭐], 🌾10[⭐], 🧱8[⭐⭐⭐]
- 🏠 at node 0: 🌲6[⭐⭐⭐], 🌲9[⭐⭐], 🌲5[⭐⭐]

The most valuable hexes for Red are:
1. 🌲6 at (0,0,0) - produces at two locations (city and settlement) with 6 probability dots
2. 🧱8 at (-2,0,2) - produces at city with 5 probability dots
3. 🌲9 at (0,1,-1) - produces at settlement with 4 probability dots

## Strategic Analysis
- Red has strong wood production (6, 9, 5 numbers on three buildings)
- Wood is critical for Red's road-building strategy (they have longest road)
- Blocking Red's wood production would slow their expansion significantly
- The 🌲6 hex at (0,0,0) is the highest value target since it affects two of Red's buildings

## Robber Placement Decision
Option [0]: Move robber to (0,0,0) and steal from RED
- Blocks a 6-value wood hex
- Affects both Red's city at node 3 and settlement at node 0
- Disrupts Red's strongest resource production
- Slows Red's road-building capacity

This is clearly the most impactful move as it blocks a high-probability resource (wood on 6) that Red relies on heavily for two different buildings.

<plan>
1. Move robber to the 6-wood hex to block Red's strongest production
2. Continue saving resources for development cards
3. Aim to get 2 more VP from development cards to reach 10 VP
4. Keep robber on Red's critical resources in future turns
5. Protect my Largest Army advantage (2 VP)
</plan>

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze my current position in detail:

**Victory Points (6/10)**:
- 2 Cities (4 VP)
- Largest Army (2 VP)
- 2 hidden Victory Point cards (2 VP)
- Total: 8 VP (with hidden cards)

**Resources**:
- 3 Brick, 3 Sheep, 5 Wheat
- No Wood or Ore

**Turn Objective**: 
I need 2 more VP to win the game. Since I already have 2 hidden VP cards, I need to find 2 more VP from either:
1. Building 2 more settlements (2 VP)
2. Getting 2 more VP development cards
3. Building 1 more city (1 VP) + 1 more settlement (1 VP)

## Strategy Assessment

The priority in this position is clear. I should aim to buy development cards since:
1. I already have 2 hidden VP cards - each new development card has a chance of being another VP card
2. I have 3 Sheep and 5 Wheat (just missing Ore for development cards)
3. Even if I don't get VP cards, Knights help maintain my Largest Army advantage
4. Red has 7 VP and has Longest Road - if they get 3 more VP, they win

## Analysis of Available Actions

Looking at my options:
- [0] End turn: Not optimal as I have 3 Sheep + 5 Wheat with no immediate build available
- [1-4] Maritime trades: They're all 4:1 trades since I don't have access to better port rates

I need Ore to buy development cards. My current plan involves continuing to save resources for development cards and maintaining my Largest Army advantage.

Given my resources, I should consider trading to get Ore so I can purchase a development card. This would require:
- 1 Ore + 1 Sheep + 1 Wheat = 1 Development Card

## Decision

Since my goal is to get development cards for potential VP cards (or Knights to protect my Largest Army), and I have the Sheep and Wheat but lack Ore, I should trade to get Ore.

Option [2] Trade port: Give 4 🌾WHEAT for 1 ⛏️ORE is the most aligned with my strategy. This will leave me with 1 Wheat, which combined with my 3 Sheep and the newly acquired Ore will allow me to buy a development card on my next turn.

<plan>
1. Trade 4 Wheat for 1 Ore via maritime trade
2. Next turn, use 1 Ore + 1 Wheat + 1 Sheep to buy a development card
3. Continue collecting resources for additional development cards
4. Move robber to high-probability hexes used by Red when possible
5. Win through combination of cities, Largest Army, and VP cards
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 81 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Trade 4 Wheat for 1 Ore via maritime trade
2. Next turn, use 1 Ore + 1 Wheat + 1 Sheep to buy a development card
3. Continue collecting resources for additional development cards
4. Move robber to high-probability hexes used by Red when possible
5. Win through combination of cities, Largest Army, and VP cards

# Game Analysis for Blue Player (Turn 81)

Let me evaluate my current situation and available options:

## Current Status
- 6/10 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + Largest Army (2 VP)
- Hidden VP: 2 Victory Point cards (not yet visible to opponents)
- Resources: 3 BRICK, 3 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE
- Red has 7 VP (likely visible): 1 settlement (1 VP) + 2 cities (4 VP) + Longest Road (2 VP)

## Available Actions
1. Buy Development Card (1 SHEEP + 1 WHEAT + 1 ORE)
2. End turn

## Strategic Analysis
My true VP count is actually 8/10 with my hidden VP cards. I only need 2 more VP to win, which could come from:
- Another VP development card
- Building and upgrading a settlement to a city

Looking at my current resources, I can buy a development card immediately. The development deck has 16 cards remaining, which likely contains:
- More VP cards (up to 3 more possible)
- Knights (would strengthen my Largest Army advantage)
- Progress cards (Road Building, Year of Plenty, Monopoly)

Any of these outcomes would be beneficial:
- VP card: immediate progress toward victory
- Knight: protects my Largest Army bonus
- Progress card: helps with resource acquisition

Since I have enough resources to buy a development card, and no other meaningful build options, this is the clear choice that aligns with my ore-wheat strategy.

<plan>
1. Buy a development card now
2. If I get a VP card, I'll be at 9 VP (just 1 away from winning)
3. Continue collecting resources for another development card
4. Protect my Largest Army advantage at all costs
5. Win through VP cards or a combination of settlement/city + VP cards

# Analysis of Game State

Let me analyze the current game state:

**Victory Points:**
- RED: 7 VP (2 cities + 1 settlement + longest road)
- BLUE (me): 6 VP (2 cities + largest army + 2 VP cards that are hidden)

**My Resources:**
- 3 BRICK, 2 SHEEP, 2 ORE
- Development Cards: 1 Knight, 2 Victory Point cards (hidden)

**Strategic Situation:**
- I'm at 6 visible VP, but actually have 8 VP with my 2 hidden VP cards
- RED is at 7 VP, just 3 away from winning
- I need 2 more VP to win
- I'm executing an ore-wheat strategy focused on development cards

## Options Analysis

**Option 0: Play Knight Card**
- This would increase my knight count to 5, further securing my largest army bonus
- I could move the robber to block a high-value hex for RED 
- I could potentially steal a useful resource from RED
- However, I don't need this defensively right now as I already have largest army

**Option 1: Roll the Dice**
- With my cities on good wheat hexes (6, 8, 11), I have strong wheat production
- I have decent ore production too from my city at node 11
- Rolling gives me a chance to collect more resources toward my victory path
- With my current resources, I can't build a city or settlement yet, but could get a development card after a good roll

## Strategic Decision

Looking at my current plan and state:
1. I have 2 hidden VP cards already (secretly at 8 VP)
2. I need just 2 more VP to win
3. My plan involves buying development cards for potential VP cards
4. With 2 ORE and 2 SHEEP, I need just 1 more WHEAT to buy a development card

Rolling the dice is the best option as it gives me a chance to gather more resources. If I roll and get wheat, I can immediately buy a development card which might be another VP card for the win.

<plan>
1. Roll the dice to collect more resources
2. If I get wheat, buy a development card hoping for a VP card to win
3. If I don't get wheat, work toward buying a development card next turn
4. Save my Knight card as a defensive measure in case RED threatens my largest army
5. Continue focusing on development cards as my path to victory
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 83 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Roll the dice to collect more resources
2. If I get wheat, buy a development card hoping for a VP card to win

4. Save my Knight card as a defensive measure in case RED threatens my largest army
5. Continue focusing on development cards as my path to victory

# Game Analysis

Let me carefully analyze the current state and my options:

## Current Game State
- I have 6 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 hidden VP cards
- I need 4 more VP to win
- Red has 7 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + longest road (2 VP)
- I have: 3 🧱BRICK, 4 🐑SHEEP, 2 ⛏️ORE
- I have 1 knight card and 2 victory point cards in hand
- I need more wheat to buy a development card (cost: 1 sheep + 1 wheat + 1 ore)

## Available Options
- Option 0: Play knight - This doesn't help my immediate goal of getting wheat
- Options 2-5: Trade 4 sheep for another resource - This is inefficient and I only have 4 sheep total

## Strategic Assessment
1. I currently have two hidden VP cards, so I actually have 8 VP total
2. I need just 2 more VP to win the game
3. My best path to victory is getting another development card and hoping for one of the remaining VP cards
4. I need wheat to buy a development card, which I don't currently have

Since this is my turn 83, I've already rolled the dice. This is the action phase where I can build, trade, or play cards.

The most sensible action right now is to end my turn since I can't efficiently trade for wheat (4:1 is very inefficient), and I should save my knight card for defensive purposes to protect my largest army.

<plan>
1. End my turn to roll the dice again
2. If I get wheat in my next roll, buy a development card
3. Continue saving knight card as defense for my largest army
4. Work toward getting the necessary resources (wheat) for a development card

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and my options:

## Current Game Status:
- I (BLUE) have 6 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
- I also have 2 hidden VP cards, bringing my real total to 8 VP
- Need 2 more VP to win (10 VP)
- RED has 7 VP: 1 settlement (1 VP) + 2 cities (4 VP) + longest road (2 VP)

## Resources:
- I have: 3 Brick, 4 Sheep, 2 Wheat, 2 Ore
- I also have 1 Knight card

## Options Analysis:

**Option 0: Play Knight Card**
- This would maintain my largest army status but not increase my VP count
- No immediate strategic threat requires robber placement
- Could steal a resource from RED, but the value is uncertain

**Option 1: Roll the Dice**
- I need more resources to progress toward 10 VP
- With my cities, I produce well from rolls
- I already have significant resources that could be augmented by a good roll
- My current path to victory is likely through development cards (for VP cards)

## Strategic Path to Victory:
I have 8 VP (including hidden VP cards). I need 2 more VP to win.
Options for 2 more VP:
1. Build 2 settlements (2 VP) - Requires 2 Wood, 2 Brick, 2 Sheep, 2 Wheat
2. Buy more VP development cards - Need more Ore/Wheat/Sheep

<plan>
1. Roll the dice to collect more resources
2. Prioritize buying development cards to find VP cards (need 1 Ore, 1 Wheat, 1 Sheep)
3. If I get good resources, consider building settlements
4. Continue protecting my largest army bonus
5. Watch for opportunity to win with my hidden VP cards
</plan>

Given my current resources and position, rolling is the best choice. I don't need to play the Knight card defensively right now, and rolling gives me the opportunity to collect more resources to advance my strategy.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 85 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Roll the dice to collect more resources
2. Prioritize buying development cards to find VP cards (need 1 Ore, 1 Wheat, 1 Sheep)
3. If I get good resources, consider building settlements
4. Continue protecting my largest army bonus
5. Watch for opportunity to win with my hidden VP cards
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze the current game state and my options carefully to determine the optimal move according to my ore-wheat strategy.

## Current Game Status
- I have 6 VP (2 cities = 4 VP + Largest Army = 2 VP + 2 hidden VP cards)
- Red player has 7 VP (2 cities = 4 VP + 1 settlement = 1 VP + Longest Road = 2 VP)
- I need 4 more VP to win
- I have resources: 3 🧱BRICK, 4 🐑SHEEP, 2 🌾WHEAT, 4 ⛏️ORE
- I have 1 KNIGHT and 2 VICTORY_POINT cards

## Options Analysis

### Buy a Development Card (Action #2)
- Cost: 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE
- I have sufficient resources (4 SHEEP, 2 WHEAT, 4 ORE)
- This aligns with my plan to find more VP cards
- This could immediately yield:
  - VP card (25% chance) - could get me to 9 VP, one away from winning
  - Knight card (50% chance) - further secure my Largest Army bonus
  - Road Building or Year of Plenty (25% chance) - useful utilities

### Play Knight Card (Action #0)
- I could play my Knight to reinforce my Largest Army bonus
- Could steal a resource from Red who has 6 cards
- However, I'm already ahead in knights (4 vs 0), so not an immediate necessity

### Maritime Trading (Actions #3-10)
- None of these trades are efficient for the ore-wheat strategy
- I'm giving up 4 resources for 1, which is a very poor exchange rate
- I already have sufficient WHEAT and ORE for a development card

### End Turn (Action #1)
- This would waste the opportunity to make progress this turn

## Decision

Based on my current position and resources, buying a development card is the optimal move. It aligns with my strategy of collecting VP cards and has a chance to give me a knight to further secure my Largest Army bonus.

<plan>
1. Buy development card to look for VP cards or knights
2. Continue protecting my Largest Army bonus
3. If I draw another VP card, I'll be at 9 VP (one away from winning)
4. Look for opportunities to build a settlement (need 1 more brick, need wood)
5. Watch for opportunity to win with my hidden VP cards
</plan>

# Game Analysis for Blue Player

I'll evaluate our current situation and available actions:

## Current Position
- I have 6 VP (2 cities = 4 VP + Largest Army = 2 VP)
- I also have 2 hidden VP development cards (this means I already have 8 VP!)
- Resources: 3 Brick, 3 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 3 Ore
- Development cards: 2 Knights, 2 Victory Point cards
- Red has 7 VP (2 cities, 1 settlement, Longest Road)

## Available Actions
0. Play Knight - Move robber and steal a resource
1. End turn
2. Buy development card (1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore)

## Strategic Analysis

Looking at my current position:
- I'm at 8 VP (including hidden VP cards) - only 2 VP away from winning!
- I can win with another VP card or by building 2 settlements
- My resources don't allow me to build a settlement (need 1 brick, 1 wood, 1 sheep, 1 wheat)
- I have enough resources to buy a development card
- I'm already ahead in the Largest Army race (4 knights vs none for Red)

The obvious choice is to buy a development card. The potential outcomes:
- Draw a VP card (20% chance): This would give me 9 VP, just 1 away from winning
- Draw a Knight (40% chance): Further secures my Largest Army bonus
- Draw Road Building/Year of Plenty/Monopoly (40% chance): Provides utility to help get resources for a settlement

<plan>
1. Buy development card to potentially get a victory point or additional knight
2. Continue securing Largest Army bonus
3. If I draw a VP card, I'll be at 9 VP - just one settlement away from winning
4. Next focus on building a settlement (need wood)
5. Watch for opportunity to win by revealing my VP cards at the right moment
</plan>

Buying a development card is clearly the optimal play to advance our ore-wheat strategy and move closer to victory.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game State Analysis

I need to analyze my current position and determine the best action:

- I have 6 VP (2 cities = 4 VP + Largest Army = 2 VP)
- I also have 3 VICTORY_POINT development cards (hidden from other players)
- This means I actually have 9 VP total, just 1 VP away from winning!
- Red has 7 VP and is my only opponent

## Resource Analysis
I currently have:
- 3 BRICK
- 2 SHEEP
- 2 ORE
- (No wood or wheat)

## Available Actions
I only have two options:
1. Play a Knight card (move robber and steal a resource)
2. End my turn

## Decision Analysis

Looking at my plan, I was intending to buy a development card, but I don't have the resources for that (need 1 ore, 1 wheat, 1 sheep). I can't build any settlements either (need wood, brick, sheep, wheat).

Playing a Knight card would:
1. Let me move the robber from the wood hex (where it's currently located)
2. Allow me to steal a resource from Red
3. Further solidify my Largest Army bonus

Since Red has 6 cards, there's a good chance I could steal something useful. Even better, I could place the robber on a critical resource hex for Red that produces wheat, which I need.

Most importantly, if I manage to steal a WHEAT card from Red, I could potentially buy a settlement next turn (I already have 3 BRICK, just need 1 WOOD, 1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT). A settlement would give me the final VP I need to win!

<plan>
1. Play Knight card - move robber to one of Red's high-value wheat hexes
2. Hope to steal wheat from Red
3. Next turn, aim to build a settlement if I get the right resources
4. If I build one more settlement, I'll have 10 VP and win!
</plan>

Given this analysis, playing the Knight card is clearly the optimal move. It gives me a chance to disrupt Red's production, potentially steal a needed resource, and gives me the best shot at winning next turn.

# Game Analysis: Playing Knight & Moving the Robber

Let me analyze the current game state to make the optimal robber placement decision:

## Victory Points Assessment
- I have 6 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + Largest Army (2 VP) + 3 hidden VP cards
- Red has 7 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + Longest Road (2 VP)
- I'm actually at 9 VP with my hidden VP cards, so I only need 1 more VP to win!

## Strategic Position
- I need resources to build a settlement (1 brick, 1 wood, 1 sheep, 1 wheat) to reach 10 VP
- I currently have 3 brick, 2 sheep, and 2 ore
- I'm missing wheat and wood to build a settlement
- Red has 6 hidden resource cards

## Robber Placement Options
Looking at Red's production:
- Red's city at node 3: 🌲6(⭐⭐⭐), ⛏️9(⭐⭐), 🐑3(⭐)
- Red's city at node 13: 🐑3(⭐), 🌾10(⭐), 🧱8(⭐⭐⭐)
- Red's settlement at node 0: 🌲6(⭐⭐⭐), 🌲9(⭐⭐), 🌲5(⭐⭐)

The most strategic options are:
1. Option [0]: Block ore production (1, -1, 0) - but no steal
2. Option [1]: Block ore production (0, -1, 1) & steal from Red
4. Option [4]: Block wood production (0, 1, -1) & steal from Red  
5. Option [5]: Block wood production (1, 0, -1) & steal from Red
9. Option [9]: Block wheat production (-1, -1, 2) & steal from Red

## Optimal Decision
I need wood or wheat the most for my settlement. Red likely has at least one of these resources given their production. The best hex to target is either:

1. Option [4] - Block the 9 wood hex that Red's settlement produces from
2. Option [5] - Block the 5 wood hex that Red's settlement produces from
3. Option [9] - Block the 10 wheat hex that Red's city produces from

Since the wheat hex has number 10 (a high probability) and is connected to Red's city, blocking it has the highest impact. Also, stealing wheat would directly help my settlement goal.

<plan>
1. Play Knight card - move robber to Red's wheat hex (10) to block their production
2. Try to steal wheat from Red
3. Next turn, trade for wood if needed and build my final settlement to reach 10 VP and win!
</plan>

Therefore, my optimal move is option [9] - block the wheat hex at (-1, -1, 2) and steal from Red.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 85 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Play Knight card - move robber to Red's wheat hex (10) to block their production
2. Try to steal wheat from Red
3. Next turn, trade for wood if needed and build my final settlement to reach 10 VP and win!
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis and Decision-Making

## Current Situation
- I have 6/10 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + Largest Army (2 VP) + 0 hidden VP cards
- I actually have 3 hidden VP cards, so my real VP count is 9/10!
- I need just 1 more VP to win
- I have 4 Brick, 2 Sheep, 2 Ore, plus 1 Knight card

## Victory Point Assessment
My fastest path to victory is to build a settlement (+1 VP). For a settlement, I need:
- 1 Brick (have 4)
- 1 Sheep (have 2)  
- 1 Wheat (don't have)
- 1 Wood (don't have)

So I need to acquire 1 Wheat and 1 Wood to build a settlement and win.

## Action Options Analysis
1. End Turn - Not optimal when I can make progress
2-4. Maritime Trade - Using 4 Brick for other resources

The logical choice is to trade for either Wheat or Wood, which I need for a settlement.

## Best Trade Decision
Since I need both Wheat and Wood, and I have 4 Brick available, I should trade for one of the missing resources. The wheat hex (10) currently has the robber, making wheat potentially harder to get next turn. Therefore, I should trade for wheat now, and try to get wood on my next turn.

<plan>
1. Trade 4 Brick for 1 Wheat (current turn)
2. Next turn: Play Knight card to move robber from wheat hex
3. Try to get 1 Wood through production or trading
4. Build final settlement to reach 10 VP and win
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I choose to trade 4 Brick for 1 Wheat:

# Game Analysis for Blue Player

Let me carefully analyze the current game state and make the optimal decision:

## Victory Point Analysis
- I currently have 6 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + Largest Army (2 VP)
- I also hold 3 hidden VP cards
- Total: 9/10 VP - I need just 1 more VP to win!

## Resources & Options
- Current resources: 2 🐑 SHEEP, 1 🌾 WHEAT, 2 ⛏️ ORE
- Development cards: 1 KNIGHT
- Available actions: End turn [0] or Buy development card [1]

## Strategic Evaluation

Looking at my situation:
1) I need only 1 more VP to win
2) I have 3 VP cards already (hidden from opponents)
3) I can buy a development card with my current resources (1🐑, 1🌾, 1⛏️)

The critical insight: If I buy a development card, it could be another VP card, which would immediately give me 10 VP total and win the game. However, development cards cannot be used the same turn they are purchased, so I'd need to wait until my next turn to claim victory.

There are 13 development cards remaining in the bank. Given that I already hold 3 VP cards and there are only 5 total VP cards in a standard game, there are at most 2 VP cards remaining. The probability of drawing a VP card is therefore at most 2/13 ≈ 15.4%.

Since I only have these two choices and buying a development card gives me a chance at drawing the winning VP card, I should take that option.

<plan>
1. Buy a development card this turn (hoping for a VP card)
2. If it's a VP card, I'll win next turn
3. If not, I'll need to:
   - Play the Knight card I'm holding if needed
   - Try to trade for or produce resources for a settlement
   - Focus on getting resources to build final settlement/road
</plan>

The optimal action is to buy a development card:

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Turn 87

I'll carefully analyze my position as the Blue player and determine the optimal action.

## Current Status
- I have 6 VP (2 cities = 4 VP + Largest Army bonus = 2 VP)
- I also have 3 hidden VP cards, which means I actually have 9 VP total!
- Resources: 1 sheep, 1 ore
- Development cards: 1 Knight, 1 Monopoly, 3 Victory Point cards
- Red has 7 visible VP and might have hidden VP cards

## Strategic Considerations
1. I'm only 1 VP away from winning (9 VP currently)
2. Options to get to 10 VP:
   - Build a settlement (need 1 brick, 1 wood, 1 sheep, 1 wheat)
   - Buy and get a VP development card (need 1 more sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore)
   - Take Longest Road from Red (very difficult, requires many roads)

## Action Analysis
- Option to roll [6]: Normal play, but I don't have enough resources to build anything significant yet
- Play Knight [5]: Would strengthen my Largest Army lead, but unnecessary since I already have it
- Play Monopoly [0-4]: This could potentially get me resources I need

The Monopoly card is my strongest option. But which resource should I target?

## Monopoly Target Analysis
- WHEAT [3]: Red might have wheat, which I need for settlements or dev cards
- BRICK [1]: I need brick for a settlement, and Red has been building roads so might have brick
- WOOD [0]: Red has been building roads, so likely has wood I need for a settlement
- ORE [4]: Already have 1, less likely valuable for Red's road strategy
- SHEEP [2]: Already have 1, need 1 more for dev card, but Red less likely to have it

## Decision Logic
I'm at 9 VP counting my hidden VP cards. The most direct path to victory is to build one settlement (1 VP). Red has been building roads extensively, so they likely have brick and wood resources. Since I need both brick and wood for a settlement, I should target one of these.

Between brick and wood, wood is more valuable now since:
1. Red has a settlement on a wood hex with THREE pips (6) and another with TWO pips (9)
2. Red has another settlement on a wood hex with TWO pips (5)
3. Red is likely to have wood stockpiled for road building

<plan>
1. Play Monopoly for WOOD
2. If successful, trade for remaining resources to build settlement
3. If not enough resources after Monopoly, roll and continue next turn
4. Save VP cards to win in a single turn to prevent opponent reaction
</plan>

The optimal action is to play Monopoly for WOOD:

# Game Analysis for Blue Player

Let me carefully analyze this game situation and make the optimal decision as a grandmaster Catan strategist focused on the ore-wheat strategy.

## Current Game State Summary
- I have 6 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + Largest Army (2 VP)
- I have 3 hidden VP cards
- I need 1 more VP to win (since I already have 9 VP total)
- I have 1 knight card available to play
- Resources: 1 sheep, 5 ore
- Red has 7 VP and Longest Road bonus

## Decision Analysis

My current plan mentioned playing Monopoly for wood, but I don't currently have a Monopoly card. I have only a knight card as my playable development card. Let's reassess my strategy:

With 3 VP development cards, I actually have 9 VP in total (6 visible + 3 hidden). I just need 1 more VP to win! The most direct way to get that last VP would be:
1. Build a settlement (1 VP)
2. Buy and draw a VP development card (chance of drawing VP is low)

Since I have 5 ore but no other resources, I can't build anything directly. Let's analyze my options:

### Option 0: Play Knight
- Advantages:
  - I can move the robber from the wheat hex to target an opponent's productive hex
  - I can steal a resource from Red, possibly getting a critical resource I need for a settlement
  - This strengthens my Largest Army position
- Disadvantages:
  - Just stealing one random card may not provide what I need to build

### Option 1: Roll the dice
- Advantages:
  - Could produce multiple resources, especially from my productive cities
  - My two cities are on excellent wheat, sheep and ore production spots
- Disadvantages:
  - Risk of a 7 forcing me to discard since I have 6 cards total
  - No guarantee of getting what I need

## Strategic Decision

Looking at my existing plan, I want to modify it given my actual situation:

<plan>
1. Roll the dice to generate more resources
2. Try to acquire brick and wood to build a settlement for the 10th VP
3. If unable to build a settlement this turn, consider buying a development card with excess ore, sheep, wheat
4. Continue to strengthen my position until I can build that final VP
5. Keep the 3 VP cards hidden until I can win in a single turn
</plan>

Given that I need specific resources (wood and brick) to build a settlement and just stealing one random card with the knight has a low probability of getting me what I need, rolling the dice offers better odds of generating multiple useful resources from my productive cities.

The knight card can be saved for later if I get a 7 on my roll or need to strengthen my Largest Army position.

Therefore, my optimal action is:

\boxed{1}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me assess our current position and determine the optimal move:

## Current Status
- **My Victory Points**: 6/10 (2 cities = 4VP + Largest Army = 2VP)
- **Hidden VPs**: 3 VP from development cards (so I actually have 9VP total!)
- **Resources**: 1 🐑 SHEEP, 2 🌾 WHEAT, 5 ⛏️ ORE
- **Development Cards**: 1 KNIGHT

## Goal Assessment
I need just 1 more VP to win (since I secretly have 9VP). The simplest way to get this is to build a settlement.

## Resource Analysis
- To build a settlement: Need 1 🧱 BRICK, 1 🌲 WOOD, 1 🐑 SHEEP, 1 🌾 WHEAT
- I currently have: 1 🐑 SHEEP, 2 🌾 WHEAT, 5 ⛏️ ORE
- I'm missing: 1 🧱 BRICK, 1 🌲 WOOD

## Options Analysis:
1. **Play Knight (Action 0)**: This doesn't help me get needed resources directly.
2. **End Turn (Action 1)**: This doesn't advance my position.
3. **Buy Development Card (Action 2)**: Could get another VP card, knight, or utility card. But even with another VP card, I would still need 1 more VP.
4. **Maritime Trade (Actions 3-6)**: I could trade ore for brick or wood, which I need for a settlement.

Since I need both wood and brick for a settlement, and I have excess ore, trading through maritime trade makes the most sense.

<plan>
1. Trade ore for both wood and brick
2. Next turn, build a settlement using 1 brick, 1 wood, 1 sheep, 1 wheat
3. Then reveal my 3 VP cards to win the game with 10 VP total
</plan>

Looking at the maritime trade options, I need to choose between getting wood (Action 4) or brick (Action 5). Since I'll need both eventually, and I can only make one trade this turn, either option is valid. I'll choose to get brick first.

# Game State Analysis

Let me carefully analyze my current position and available options:

## Victory Points Calculation:
- I have 6 VP currently visible: 2 cities (4 VP) + Largest Army (2 VP)
- I have 3 hidden Victory Point cards = 3 VP
- Total: 9 VP (only need 1 more to win!)

## Resources:
- 1 Brick, 1 Sheep, 2 Wheat, 1 Ore
- Not enough for building a settlement (need 1 Wood)

## Current Plan Review:
My plan was to trade Ore for both Wood and Brick, then build a settlement next turn. However, I already have Brick, so I only need Wood. I have 9 VP total, and just need 1 more to reach 10 and win.

## Available Actions Analysis:

1. **Play Knight**:
   - I already have Largest Army with 5 knights
   - This would move the robber and potentially steal a resource (maybe Wood?)
   - Doesn't directly help me get to 10 VP

2. **End Turn**:
   - This preserves my resources but makes no progress toward victory

3. **Buy Development Card**:
   - Cost: 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore (I have these resources)
   - Potential outcomes:
     - Victory Point card (25% chance) = immediate win
     - Knight card (50% chance) = no immediate progress
     - Progress card (25% chance) = potentially useful

## Decision Logic:

My goal is to reach 10 VP as efficiently as possible. With 9 VP already (including hidden VP cards), I need just 1 more VP.

The development card purchase is my best option. If I draw a Victory Point card, I win immediately. If I draw another card type, I still have my original plan as backup - trade for Wood next turn and build a settlement.

Since the bank has 12 development cards remaining, there's a reasonable chance some Victory Point cards are still available (max 5 in the game, I've seen 3 so far). This gives me a chance to win this turn rather than waiting.

<plan>
1. Buy a development card, hoping for a Victory Point card to win immediately
2. If not a VP card, next turn trade for Wood, build settlement, and reveal VP cards to win

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze my current game state and strategic position:

**Current Victory Points (6/10):**
- 2 Cities: 4 VP
- Largest Army bonus: 2 VP
- Hidden VP cards: 3 VP (not visible to opponents)

I'm actually at 9/10 VP once I count my hidden Victory Point cards! Just need 1 more VP to win.

**Resources:**
- 1 Brick
- 1 Wheat
- Limited options for immediate builds

**Development Cards:**
- 2 Knight cards available
- 3 Victory Point cards (hidden)

## Strategy Assessment

My original plan was:
1. Buy a development card hoping for VP
2. If not VP, trade for Wood and build settlement

However, I can't buy a development card this turn as I only have 1 Brick and 1 Wheat (need Ore, Wheat, Sheep).

Looking at the available actions, I have only two options:
1. Play a Knight card (move robber and steal)
2. End my turn

## Decision Analysis

**Option 0: Play Knight card**
- Would strengthen my Largest Army (already have it with 5 knights)
- Could steal a resource from an opponent
- Might disrupt RED's production, who is at 7 VP
- Could potentially get a resource I need for future builds

**Option 1: End Turn**
- Save my Knight card for future protection
- Wait for resource production on next roll
- No immediate progress this turn

Looking at my VP count again:
- 4 VP from cities
- 2 VP from Largest Army
- 3 VP from hidden Victory Point cards
= 9 VP total

I only need 1 more VP to win! Since I can't build this turn with my current resources, and playing a Knight won't get me to 10 VP, I should end my turn and wait for the next roll.

<plan>
1. End turn now
2. On next roll, gather resources and look for opportunity to:
   a) Build a settlement (if I get Wood, Brick, Wheat, Sheep) for the last VP
   b) OR buy a development card hoping for VP (if I get Ore, Wheat, Sheep)
3. Once I reach 10 VP, reveal my Victory Point cards and win
</plan>

Since I'm at 9 VP (with hidden cards) and can't make meaningful progress this turn, I'll end my turn.

# Game State Analysis

I need to analyze the current game state and decide between playing a Knight card (0) or rolling the dice (1).

## Victory Points Assessment
- I currently have 6 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + Largest Army (2 VP)
- I have 3 hidden Victory Point cards, giving me a total of 9 VP already
- I only need 1 more VP to win the game

## Resources & Available Actions
- I have 1 brick and 1 wheat
- I can't build a settlement (need brick, wood, wheat, sheep)
- I can't build a city (need 3 ore, 2 wheat)
- I can't buy a development card (need ore, wheat, sheep)
- With current resources, I can't make immediate progress

## Strategic Options
1. **Play Knight Card (Option 0)**:
   - Advantages: Could steal a useful resource, protect my high-producing hexes
   - Disadvantages: Uses a Knight card unnecessarily when I already have Largest Army

2. **Roll Dice (Option 1)**:
   - Advantages: Gather more resources to build what I need for the final VP
   - Disadvantages: Risk of 7 with only 2 cards is minimal

## Decision Logic
I need just 1 more VP to win. The most efficient paths:
- Build a settlement (need wood, brick, wheat, sheep)
- Buy a development card hoping for VP (need ore, wheat, sheep)

Playing a Knight doesn't help with either path. Rolling will give me resources I need.

<plan>
1. Roll the dice to acquire more resources
2. Based on roll results:
   a) If I get resources for a settlement (need wood, brick), build final settlement
   b) If I get ore and sheep, buy development card hoping for VP
   c) If I don't get what I need, make strategic trades or end turn
3. Win on next turn by revealing my 3 VP cards when I get the 10th point
</plan>

The optimal action is to roll the dice.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game State Analysis

I need to analyze my current position and determine the optimal move in this Settlers of Catan game:

## Current Victory Points (VP):
- Me (BLUE): 6 VP (2 cities = 4 VP + Largest Army = 2 VP)
- Hidden VP: 3 VP cards in hand
- Total actual VP: 9 VP (only need 1 more to win)
- RED: 7 VP visible (2 cities + 1 settlement + Longest Road)

## Resources:
- I have: 1 BRICK, 2 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT
- I need 1 more VP to win the game

## Options:
1. Play Knight card (Option 0)
   - Would move the robber and steal a resource from RED
   - RED has 8 hidden cards, potentially useful resources
   - But I already have Largest Army secured with 5 knights played

2. End Turn (Option 1)
   - Keep my current resources
   - If I roll well on next turn, I might get necessary resources for winning

## Strategic Considerations:
- I have 3 VP cards in hand, meaning I only need 1 more VP to reach 10 and win
- With 2 cities on good production spots, I can likely get resources on my next roll
- Playing a knight doesn't progress me toward victory - I already have Largest Army
- RED has 7 VP and could potentially reach 10 VP on their next turn
- The robber is already not on any of my hexes (it's on RED's wheat hex)

<plan>
1. End my turn to conserve resources
2. On next turn, aim to build a settlement (1 more VP needed)
3. If I roll resources needed for settlement or development card, I can win immediately by revealing my 3 VP cards 
4. Save knights for defense only if robber threatens my key hexes
</plan>

Given I'm at 9 VP (with my hidden cards) and need just 1 more to win, and I don't need another knight for Largest Army, playing a knight would be suboptimal. The best move is to end my turn and hope for good rolls next turn.

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze my current situation and make the best strategic decision:

## Current Game State
- I have 6 VP visible (2 cities = 4 VP + Largest Army = 2 VP)
- I have 3 hidden VP cards = 3 VP
- Total: 9 VP (I need 10 VP to win)
- I need 1 more VP to win
- Resources: 1 Brick, 2 Sheep, 1 Wheat (not enough for any major build)
- I have 2 Knight cards available

## Options Analysis
**Option 0: Play Knight card**
- Pros:
  - Could steal a useful resource from opponent
  - Might block a high-value hex for opponent
- Cons: 
  - I already have Largest Army secured (5 knights)
  - I should save knights for defense of my key production hexes
  - Using a knight now doesn't advance my win condition

**Option 1: Roll the dice**
- Pros: 
  - Chance to get resources needed for a settlement (1 more VP)
  - I need Ore + Wood + Brick for another settlement
  - After rolling, I can still play a knight if needed
  - If I roll resources needed, I can build and win immediately by revealing my VP cards
- Cons:
  - Risk of rolling 7 and losing resources

## Decision Logic
I need 1 more VP to win. With my 3 hidden VP cards, I just need to build one more settlement to reach 10 VP. Rolling gives me a chance to get the needed resources, while playing a knight now adds no immediate value toward my win condition.

<plan>
1. Roll the dice to acquire more resources
2. If I get enough resources, build a settlement for my final VP
3. Reveal my 3 VP cards at the appropriate time to win
4. Save knights for defending key hexes only if needed
</plan>

The most strategic choice is clear:

3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 93 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Roll the dice to acquire more resources
2. If I get enough resources, build a settlement for my final VP
3. Reveal my 3 VP cards at the appropriate time to win
4. Save knights for defending key hexes only if needed
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

I need to carefully assess my position and make the optimal choice to move toward victory.

## Current Game State
- I have 6 visible VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
- I have 3 hidden VP from development cards
- This means I actually have 9 VP total, just 1 away from winning
- I need 1 more VP to win, which could come from:
  - Building a settlement (1 VP)
  - Building a city (2 VP)
  - Buying a development card that might be a VP card (20% chance)

## Resource Analysis
I currently have:
- 1 brick, 2 sheep, 1 wheat
- Not enough for a settlement (need brick, wood, sheep, wheat)
- Not enough for a city (need 3 ore, 2 wheat)
- Not enough for a development card (need 1 ore, 1 sheep, 1 wheat)

## Available Actions
1. Play Knight card - Move robber and steal a resource
2. End turn

## Decision Logic
I'm just 1 VP away from winning with my 3 hidden VP cards. My goal should be to get the resources needed to build one more settlement.

Playing a Knight card would allow me to:
1. Move the robber from the wheat hex where it's currently placed
2. Potentially steal a critical resource from RED
3. This could help me gather resources I need for a settlement

If I end my turn, I'll just have to rely on my next dice roll to get the resources I need.

Since I still need wood and additional resources to build a settlement, and RED has 6 cards, playing the Knight gives me the best chance to make progress this turn.

<plan>
1. Play Knight to move the robber and steal a resource from RED
2. Try to acquire wood through future rolls or trades
3. Build a settlement when I have the necessary resources
4. Reveal my 3 VP cards to reach 10 VP and win
</plan>

RESPONSE:
# Game Analysis: Robber Placement Decision

I need to decide where to place the robber to maximize my strategic advantage. Let's analyze the game state thoroughly:

## Current Game Status
- I'm at 6 VP (2 cities = 4 VP + Largest Army = 2 VP)
- I have 3 hidden VP cards, which means I actually have 9 VP total
- RED has 7 VP (2 cities = 4 VP + 1 settlement = 1 VP + Longest Road = 2 VP)
- I'm just 1 VP away from winning!

## My Resources and Needs
- Current resources: 1 brick, 2 sheep, 1 wheat
- To win, I need to build a settlement (1 brick, 1 wood, 1 wheat, 1 sheep)
- I'm missing WOOD to build a settlement and win the game

## RED Player's Production
Let me examine RED's production:
- City at node 3: Wood(6★★★), Ore(9★★), Sheep(3★)
- City at node 13: Sheep(3★), Wheat(10★), Brick(8★★★)
- Settlement at node 0: Wood(6★★★), Wood(9★★), Wood(5★★)

RED has extremely strong WOOD production from node 0, which produces from THREE wood hexes, including a high-probability 6.

## Optimal Robber Placement
The hex (0,0,0) is the wood hex with number 6, which is very high probability (★★★). This hex is connected to RED's settlement at node 0. Blocking this hex would:
- Significantly reduce RED's wood production
- Potentially allow me to steal a wood resource card
- Prevent RED from continuing to build roads and extend their longest road

<plan>
1. Move robber to Wood hex (0,0,0) to block RED's best wood production
2. Steal a resource from RED hoping for wood
3. Save resources until I can build a settlement (need wood)
4. Reveal my 3 VP cards when I build the settlement to reach 10 VP and win
</plan>

The best action is to choose option [0]: Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED.

You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 95 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Move robber to Wood hex (0,0,0) to block RED's best wood production
2. Steal a resource from RED hoping for wood
3. Save resources until I can build a settlement (need wood)
4. Reveal my 3 VP cards when I build the settlement to reach 10 VP and win
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.
  To adjust your plan, provide a NEW PLAN in your reasoning with <plan>your new plan</plan>

❓ Select action by number (0-1):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state carefully to determine the optimal action.

## Game State Analysis

- I have 6 VP total: 2 cities (4 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
- I also have 3 hidden VP development cards
- This means my actual total is 9 VP, just 1 VP away from winning
- I need 1 more VP to win, which would require building a settlement

### Resources
- Current resources: 1 BRICK, 3 SHEEP, 3 WHEAT
- To build a settlement, I need: BRICK + WOOD + SHEEP + WHEAT
- I'm missing WOOD to build a settlement
- The robber is currently on a WOOD hex (0,0,0)

### Opponent Status
- RED has 7 VP (visible) with 5 hidden resource cards
- RED has longest road (+2 VP)
- RED may be close to winning

## Options Analysis

Option 0: Play Knight card
- This would allow me to move the robber off the WOOD hex
- I could potentially steal WOOD from RED (they have 5 cards)
- This increases my chances of getting the WOOD I need for a settlement

Option 1: Roll the dice
- If I roll, there's a chance I get resources naturally
- However, the robber is on a WOOD hex, which blocks my chance of getting that critical resource
- If I don't roll a 6, I won't be able to build a settlement this turn

## Decision

I should play the Knight card to move the robber off the WOOD hex and potentially steal a WOOD resource from RED. This gives me the best chance to acquire the WOOD I need to build a settlement this turn, which would put me at 10 VP with my hidden VP cards.

<plan>
1. Play Knight to move robber away from Wood hex (0,0,0)
2. Steal a resource from RED hoping for wood
3. Roll dice to gather more resources
4. If I get wood, build a settlement
5. Reveal my 3 VP cards when I build the settlement to reach 10 VP and win

# Analysis of Game State

I'm playing as BLUE with these key points:
- I have 6 visible VP (2 cities for 4 VP + 2 VP from Largest Army)
- I have 3 hidden Victory Point cards (worth 3 VP)
- That means I actually have 9 VP total, just 1 VP away from winning
- I need to build 1 settlement to win the game immediately
- Resources: 1 BRICK, 3 SHEEP, 3 WHEAT (missing WOOD for settlement)
- Currently playing a Knight card, which moved the robber from wood hex (0,0,0)

## Robber Placement Strategy

First, let's identify RED's most valuable hexes to target:
- Node 3: RED has a city producing from 🌲6[⭐⭐⭐], ⛏️9[⭐⭐], 🐑3[⭐]
- Node 13: RED has a city producing from 🐑3[⭐], 🌾10[⭐], 🧱8[⭐⭐⭐]
- Node 0: RED has a settlement producing from 🌲6[⭐⭐⭐], 🌲9[⭐⭐], 🌲5[⭐⭐]

I need WOOD to build my settlement and win. Looking at the available robber placement options, I should target a hex that:
1. Ideally blocks RED's wood production
2. Allows me to steal from RED, hoping to get wood

Looking at the options, action [4] allows me to move the robber to (0, 1, -1) which is a WOOD hex with value 9 (high probability) AND allows me to steal from RED. Specifically, this is one of RED's settlement's wood hexes at node 0.

This is the optimal choice because:
- It blocks a high-value wood hex that RED is using
- It gives me a chance to steal a resource from RED, potentially wood
- If I succeed in getting wood, I can build a settlement and reveal my VP cards to win immediately

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

RESPONSE:
# Analysis of Game State

I need to choose wisely where to place the robber, considering:
- I currently have 6 VP (2 cities = 4 VP + largest army = 2 VP)
- I also have 3 hidden victory point cards, which gives me a total of 9 VP
- I need to build just 1 more settlement to reach 10 VP and win
- I currently have Wood(1), Brick(1), Sheep(1), Wheat(1) - I need exactly these resources for a settlement

## Strategic Priorities:
1. I need to steal a resource from RED to improve my position
2. I should disrupt RED's resource production to slow them down (they're at 7 VP)
3. Target high-value hexes that RED depends on

## Best Robber Placement Options:

0. Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED:
   - This is the Wood hex with probability 6 (good value)
   - RED has a city adjacent to this hex, so it would disrupt their Wood production
   - Wood is valuable for RED who is building roads for longest road

5. Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED:
   - This is a Wood hex with probability 5 (moderate value)
   - RED has a settlement adjacent to this hex
   - Less impactful than option 0

10. Move robber to (-2, 0, 2) and steal from RED:
   - This is a Brick hex with probability 8 (high value)
   - RED has a city adjacent to this hex
   - Would disrupt their Brick production, which they need for roads

<plan>
1. Move robber to (0, 0, 0) Wood hex (probability 6) and steal from RED
2. Hope to get useful resource from RED, ideally Wood or Brick to have double
3. Build a settlement with my Brick+Wood+Wheat+Sheep
4. Reveal my 3 VP cards to reach 10 VP and win
</plan>

After careful consideration, option 0 is the best choice as it targets a high-value Wood hex where RED has a city. This will limit RED's expansion ability while giving me a chance to steal a valuable resource.

# Game Analysis

I need to review my current position and options carefully to determine the optimal move.

## Current Position
- I have 6 visible VP (2 cities = 4VP + Largest Army = 2VP)
- I have 3 hidden VICTORY_POINT development cards = 3VP
- Total: 9VP (I need 10VP to win)
- Resources: 1 Wood, 2 Brick, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat
- Opponent (RED) has 7 visible VP

## Available Options

1. I could build a road (actions 1-7), but this doesn't help me win immediately
2. I could build a settlement (actions 8-11), which would give me +1VP, bringing my total to 10VP
3. I could end my turn (action 0)

## Settlement Locations
Let me evaluate the settlement options:
- Node 38: On Sheep-8 hex (good probability) and adjacent to Wood port
- Node 40: On Wheat-6 hex (excellent probability) and Ore port
- Node 41: On Wheat-6 hex (excellent probability)
- Node 42: Only on Wheat-6 hex (excellent probability)

Node 40 is particularly attractive as it gives me access to both a high probability Wheat hex and an Ore port.

## Winning Strategy
Since I need exactly 1 more VP to win, and I have the exact resources needed (1 Wood, 2 Brick, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat) to build a settlement, I should build a settlement immediately. This will give me 10 VP total and secure the win.

Of the settlement options, node 40 offers the best long-term value due to the Ore port and Wheat-6 hex. However, since any settlement gives me the winning point, I'll choose node 40 for the strategic advantage.

<plan>
1. Build a settlement at node 40 to reach 10 VP (7 visible + 3 hidden)
2. Reveal VP cards if needed to confirm victory
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I'll build a settlement at node 40.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 1 | Player: BLUE | Action: BUILD_INITIAL_SETTLEMENT

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build a settlement at node 40 to reach 10 VP (7 visible + 3 hidden)
2. Reveal VP cards if needed to confirm victory
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Analysis for Initial Settlement Placement

I need to place my first settlement optimally, following the "ore-wheat strategy" while ensuring maximum probability for resource generation. Let me analyze the board to find the best node.

## Key Priorities:
1. Target high probability ORE and WHEAT hexes (numbers 6, 8, 5, 9)
2. Maximize "pip count" (probability dots)
3. Consider resource diversity
4. Plan ahead for future expansion and city upgrades

## Notable Hex Locations:
- ORE: (0,-2,2) with 6⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐, (-2,2,0) with 8⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐, (1,-1,0) with 12⭐
- WHEAT: (1,0,-1) with 6⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐, (2,0,-2) with 9⭐⭐⭐⭐, (-2,0,2) with 4⭐, (0,2,-2) with 11⭐
- WOOD: (1,-2,1) with 10⭐⭐, (-1,1,0) with 4⭐, (1,1,-2) with 8⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- SHEEP: (2,-2,0) with 10⭐⭐, (0,-1,1) with 3⭐, (-1,2,-1) with 5⭐⭐⭐, (0,1,-1) with 3⭐
- BRICK: (-1,-1,2) with 11⭐, (2,-1,-1) with 5⭐⭐⭐, (-1,0,1) with 2⭐

## Best Nodes Evaluation:
- Node 7: Access to ORE 12⭐, SHEEP 10⭐⭐, WOOD 10⭐⭐, BRICK 5⭐⭐⭐ = 8 pips, diverse resources
- Node 8: Access to ORE 12⭐, SHEEP 10⭐⭐, WOOD 10⭐⭐ = 5 pips
- Node 9: Access to ORE 12⭐, SHEEP 3⭐, WOOD 10⭐⭐ = 4 pips
- Node 22: Access to WOOD 8⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐, WHEAT 6⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐, WHEAT 9⭐⭐⭐⭐ = 14 pips (very high!)
- Node 23: Access to BRICK 5⭐⭐⭐, WHEAT 6⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐, WHEAT 9⭐⭐⭐⭐ = 12 pips, includes wheat
- Node 39: Access to ORE 8⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐, Desert, BRICK port = 5 pips + port
- Node 40: Access to ORE 8⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐, SHEEP 5⭐⭐⭐, 3:1 port = 8 pips + port

Based on my ore-wheat strategy, Node 22 stands out as exceptional with access to high-probability wheat (both 6 and 9) plus wood 8, totaling 14 pips. This is the perfect first settlement location - it secures abundant wheat production which is critical for both settlements and cities, while also providing strong wood income.

<plan>
1. Place initial settlement at Node 22 (combines two wheat hexes with 6 and 9, plus wood 8)
2. Place second settlement on a good ore hex, ideally node 40 or another high-value ore location
3. Build a third settlement for any missing critical resources
4. Focus on city upgrades at wheat+ore settlements
5. Pursue largest army through development cards
</plan>

For my first settlement, I'll select Node 22 with its outstanding 14 pip count and critical wheat resource focus.

# Analyzing the Initial Road Placement

I need to carefully analyze my options for the initial road placement, considering my established settlement and future expansion plans.

## Current Game State
- I (BLUE) have my first settlement at node 26, which currently only produces 🐑10 (sheep, probability 1/12)
- This settlement is already on a 2:1 WOOD port, which will be valuable later
- RED has their first settlement at node 20 with excellent production (🐑3, 🌾6, 🌲8)

## Available Options
[0] Build road at edge (26, 27) - This extends east
[1] Build road at edge (25, 26) - This extends west

## Analyzing Option 0: Road (26, 27)
- This road moves toward node 27, connecting to the sheep hex (10) and wood hex (10)
- Further expansion could reach node 29 (sheep hex 10 + wood hex 10 + ore hex 6)
- But this direction leads toward less valuable number tokens (10s are low probability)
- No high-value ore or wheat hexes in this direction

## Analyzing Option 1: Road (25, 26)
- This road moves toward node 25, potentially reaching:
  - Node 24: connects to sheep (10) + wood (10) + brick (5)
  - Further expanding to node 23: connects to brick (5) + wheat (9) + wheat (6)
  - Node 52: connects to wheat (9) + brick (5)
- The wheat hex with 9 is very valuable (high probability)
- Node 23 could be an excellent second settlement with access to two wheat hexes (6 and 9)

## Strategic Consideration
Following the ore-wheat strategy:
- I need to secure good wheat and ore production
- Option 1 gives me a path toward the high-value wheat hexes (9 and 6)
- The southwest region has better combinations of wheat and would allow me to expand toward node 23 (combining wheat 6 + wheat 9 + brick 5)

<plan>
1. Place initial road at edge (25, 26) to move toward wheat-heavy region
2. Aim to place second settlement at node 23 (combines wheat 6 + wheat 9 + brick 5)
3. Then focus on finding an ore-producing settlement location
4. Quickly upgrade settlements to cities, particularly at node 23 once built
5. Use the 2:1 wood port for efficient trading as needed
</plan>

Based on the above analysis, I choose option 1 to build a road at edge (25, 26), moving toward the wheat-heavy region which aligns with our ore-wheat strategy.

\boxed{1}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 1 | Player: BLUE | Action: BUILD_INITIAL_SETTLEMENT

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Place initial road at edge (25, 26) to move toward wheat-heavy region
2. Aim to place second settlement at node 23 (combines wheat 6 + wheat 9 + brick 5)
3. Then focus on finding an ore-producing settlement location
4. Quickly upgrade settlements to cities, particularly at node 23 once built
5. Use the 2:1 wood port for efficient trading as needed

I need to place my second initial settlement strategically to maximize my chances of winning with the ore-wheat strategy. This is a crucial decision that will impact the entire game.

1. High probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9) with priority on ore and wheat
2. Maximum "pip count" (probability dots)
3. Resource diversity (complement my first settlement)
4. Must be on opposite side of the board from my first settlement
5. Strategic positioning for future expansion

## Current Assessment:
- My first settlement is at node 26, which only produces sheep (10) - not ideal
- I have a 2:1 wood port access, which could be useful
- RED player has an excellent settlement at node 20 with sheep(3), wheat(6), wood(8)

## Best Options Analysis:

Node 23 stands out as exceptional:
- Produces wheat(6), wheat(9), and brick(5)
- This gives me access to two high-probability wheat hexes (6 and 9)
- 6 and 9 are the second and third best probabilities (5 and 4 dots respectively)
- Total pip count: 5+4+2 = 11 dots (very high)
- Brick access helps for initial expansion
- On opposite side of board from my first settlement
- Supplements my current settlement which has no wheat

Node 52 is also interesting (wheat(9), brick(5)), but node 23 is superior with its double wheat access.

Node 31 would give access to ore(6), but node 23's double wheat is more valuable for the ore-wheat strategy as we can trade wheat efficiently.

<plan>
1. Place second initial settlement at node 23 (wheat 6, wheat 9, brick 5)
2. Focus on acquiring ore access through strategic expansion 
3. Use wheat production and 2:1 wood port to trade for ore
4. Quickly upgrade settlements to cities, particularly at node 23
5. Aim for 2-3 cities by mid-game for dominant production
</plan>

Based on thorough analysis, I'll select node 23 for my second initial settlement:

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Initial Road Placement

I need to analyze my options carefully for placing my initial road from my settlement at node 23. This decision is crucial as it sets the direction for my early expansion.

## Examining the Options

**[0] Build a road at edge (23, 52)** - This road would lead southeast toward the general 3:1 port at nodes 52, 53.
- Heads toward: A general 3:1 port
- Future resource access: No new immediate resources visible in that direction
- Strategic value: Limited expansion options visible

**[1] Build a road at edge (22, 23)** - This road would lead west toward the wheat 6 and wheat 9 hexes.
- Heads toward: Node 22 which connects to wheat 6, wheat 9 tiles
- Future resource access: Could eventually reach toward wood 8 tile
- Strategic value: Good centralized position for future expansion

**[2] Build a road at edge (6, 23)** - This road would lead northeast toward wood 8 and ore 12 hexes.
- Heads toward: Node 6 which connects to brick 5 and ore 12 tiles
- Future resource access: Critical ore access possible
- Strategic value: Expands toward less settled area of the board

## Strategic Considerations

1. **Resource Analysis**: I need ore for my ore-wheat strategy, and ore is the resource I'm completely missing from my initial settlements.

2. **Expansion Potential**: Road option [2] gives me potential access to ore, which aligns perfectly with the ore-wheat strategy I'm pursuing.

3. **Board Position**: The northeast area (option [2]) appears less contested currently, giving me better chances of successful expansion.

4. **Long-term Planning**: Getting access to ore is critical for city development, which is the cornerstone of the ore-wheat strategy.

<plan>
1. Build initial road toward ore access (edge 6, 23)
2. Prioritize building a settlement near ore production
3. Use my strong wheat production and wood port to fuel expansion and trades
4. Quickly upgrade settlements to cities, particularly my wheat-producing settlement at node 23
5. Aim for 2-3 cities by mid-game for dominant resource production
</plan>

After analyzing all options, I'll choose option [2] which builds a road at edge (6, 23), as this directly supports my ore-wheat strategy by moving toward ore access.

Let me think through this strategically by evaluating the game state and potential robber placements.

## Current Game State Analysis
- I'm pursuing an ore-wheat strategy but need better ore access
- My settlements are at nodes 23 (produces wheat×2 and brick) and 26 (produces only sheep)
- RED has settlements at node 11 (producing ore, sheep, brick) and node 20 (producing wheat, sheep, wood)
- RED is ahead on resources with 4 cards (hidden)
- The robber is currently on (2, 0, -2), which is a wheat hex with value 9, blocking one of my settlements

## Strategic Considerations
1. I should target high-value hexes that RED depends on
2. I should prioritize disrupting RED's ore and wheat production (to block their city strategy)
3. I should try to steal a resource that will help me build
4. I should remove the robber from my wheat production

## Evaluating Top Options:

### Option 9: Move robber to (0, -2, 2) and steal from RED
- This targets RED's ore production on a high-value hex (ore with value 6)
- RED has a settlement at node 11 producing from this hex
- This directly disrupts RED's ability to build cities (core to ore-wheat strategy)
- This hex has 3 pips (high probability)

### Option 6: Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED
- This targets RED's wheat production on hex with value 6
- RED has a settlement at node 20 producing from this hex
- This also has 3 pips (high probability)

### Option 16: Move robber to (1, 1, -2) and steal from RED
- This targets RED's wood production on hex with value 8
- RED has a settlement at node 20 producing from this hex
- This hex has 3 pips (high probability)

## Final Decision
Option 9 is optimal as it blocks RED's access to ore (value 6), which is:
1. Critical for the ore-wheat city strategy
2. One of the most valuable resources in the game
3. A resource RED already has access to that I don't
4. A high-probability hex (6 = 3 pips)
5. Allows me to steal a resource from RED

<plan>
1. Block RED's ore production to slow their progress
2. Continue building toward ore access for my own settlements
3. Leverage my wheat production with my wood port to trade for needed resources
4. Upgrade to cities as soon as I acquire consistent ore access
5. Target 3 cities by mid/late game for maximum production
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 5 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Block RED's ore production to slow their progress
2. Continue building toward ore access for my own settlements
3. Leverage my wheat production with my wood port to trade for needed resources
4. Upgrade to cities as soon as I acquire consistent ore access
5. Target 3 cities by mid/late game for maximum production
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis: Moving the Robber

## Current Situation Assessment:
- I have 2 settlements producing wheat, brick, and sheep
- RED has 2 settlements with strong production: ore(6), wheat(6), wood(8), sheep(3), brick(11)
- The robber is currently on ore hex (0,-2,2) with value 6
- I need to block RED's strong resource production while planning for city upgrades

## Key Strategic Insights:
1. RED has much better resource production than I do, especially for ore and wood
2. My strategy requires ore and wheat for city upgrades
3. RED's settlement at node 20 produces wheat(6) and wood(8) - both high-value resources
4. RED's settlement at node 11 produces ore(6) - a critical resource for the ore-wheat strategy

## Robber Move Options Analysis:

Most impactful options:
- [6] Move to (1,0,-1) wheat(6) hex, affecting RED's settlement at node 20
- [15] Move to (1,1,-2) wood(8) hex, affecting RED's settlement at node 20 
- [2] Move to (0,-1,1) sheep(3) hex, affecting RED's settlement at node 11

Looking deeper:
- Option [6] blocks wheat(6) production - this is a critical resource for both RED and my ore-wheat strategy
- Option [15] blocks wood(8) production - this would slow RED's expansion but doesn't directly affect the ore-wheat strategy
- Option [2] only blocks sheep(3) production - not as impactful

## Decision:
I should move the robber to the wheat(6) hex. This:
1. Blocks RED's access to a critical resource for city building
2. Allows me to steal a resource card from RED
3. Protects the ore hex (robber already moved away)
4. Directly supports my ore-wheat strategy by limiting RED's wheat income

<plan>
1. Block RED's wheat(6) production to slow their city upgrades
2. Continue building toward ore access for my settlements
3. Leverage my wheat production with my wood port to trade for needed resources
4. Upgrade to cities as soon as I acquire consistent ore access
5. Target 3 cities by mid/late game for maximum production
</plan>

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and evaluate my options:

## Current Resources
- I have 4 BRICK, 2 SHEEP, 2 WHEAT
- Notably missing ORE and WOOD

## Current Victory Points & Position
- I have 2 VP (from 2 settlements)
- RED has 3 VP (1 settlement, 1 city)
- RED is ahead and has a strong production setup with a city on a wheat(6) hex

## Production Analysis
- My settlements produce BRICK, SHEEP, and WHEAT, but I lack ORE and WOOD
- I have a WOOD port (2:1), which is valuable but I don't produce wood

## Available Actions
I can:
- End turn [0]
- Trade 4 BRICK for 1 SHEEP [1]
- Trade 4 BRICK for 1 WHEAT [2]
- Trade 4 BRICK for 1 ORE [3]
- Trade 4 BRICK for 1 WOOD [4]

## Strategic Evaluation

My current plan involves blocking RED's production and gaining access to ORE for city upgrades. However, my immediate actions are limited.

While I could trade 4 BRICK for 1 ORE to start moving toward my city-upgrading goal, this would be an inefficient trade. My plan calls for better ORE access through expansion rather than poor trades.

The robber is currently on a wood hex (0,0,0), and RED has a strong wheat(6) production with their city. Moving the robber there would be ideal, but I don't have that option this turn.

Since I can't build anything useful with my current resources (can't build a road, settlement or city), and the available trades are inefficient (4:1 is a poor rate), the best move is to simply end my turn and wait for better opportunities through dice rolls.

<plan>
1. Continue saving resources for strategic builds
2. Target expansion toward ORE hexes to enable city upgrades
3. When possible, use the robber on RED's wheat(6) hex to slow their city production
4. Use my wood port (2:1) when I acquire wood
5. Focus on upgrading to cities once I secure ORE access
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Analyzing the Robber Move Options

I need to choose the most strategic hex to move the robber to. Let me analyze the current game state and my options carefully.

## Game State Analysis
- I (BLUE) have only 2 VPs from 2 settlements
- RED has 3 VPs (1 settlement + 1 city)
- RED is ahead of me and has 5 hidden cards
- I need to focus on ORE and WHEAT for my city-focused strategy

## My Current Resources
- 2 BRICK, 2 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT
- I'm lacking ORE which is crucial for city upgrades

## RED's Production
RED has valuable production from:
1. City at node 20: SHEEP(3), WHEAT(6★★★), WOOD(8★★★)
2. Settlement at node 11: SHEEP(3), ORE(6★★★), BRICK(11★)

## Robber Placement Analysis
Looking at the options, I should:
1. Prioritize blocking RED's high-value production tiles
2. Block resources I most need to slow RED's progress (WHEAT and ORE)
3. Steal a card from RED if possible

The most impactful options are:
- Option [8]: Move to (0, -2, 2) - RED's ORE(6) hex with ★★★ probability
- Option [5]: Move to (1, 0, -1) - RED's WHEAT(6) hex with ★★★ probability

Both hexes have the highest production value (6), but I should prioritize blocking RED's access to the resource that will most help them build cities - which aligns with my ORE-WHEAT strategy.

<plan>
1. Block RED's ORE production to slow their city building
2. Save resources for getting my first city up
3. Look for opportunities to expand to better ORE/WHEAT spots
4. Use my wood port strategically when I get wood
5. Maintain focus on the ORE-WHEAT strategy for cities
</plan>

Since I'm pursuing an ORE-WHEAT strategy, blocking RED's ORE production at hex (0, -2, 2) is my optimal move. This will significantly slow RED's city-building ability while giving me a chance to steal a resource from them.

# Strategic Analysis for Robber Placement

I need to analyze the best hex to place the robber to maximize my advantage while minimizing RED's progress toward victory.

## RED Player Analysis
- RED has 4 VP: 1 city (2 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP)
- RED has key production: Wheat 6 (excellent) and Wheat 9 (good) 
- RED has Wood 8 (excellent) and Wood 9 (good)
- RED is ahead of me by 2 VP and has better resource production overall

## My Position
- I have 2 VP from my 2 settlements
- My current resources: 1 Brick, 2 Sheep, 2 Wheat
- I need Ore for city upgrades (my main strategy)
- My wheat production is decent, but my ore production is non-existent

## Optimal Robber Placement Considerations
1. Disrupt RED's key resources (especially ore and wheat)
2. Target hexes that affect multiple RED buildings
3. Choose hexes with high probability (6, 8) when possible
4. Steal a valuable resource if possible

Looking at the hexes with RED's buildings:
- Hex (0, 0, 0): Wood 9 - affects RED's settlement at node 1
- Hex (1, 0, -1): Wheat 6 - affects RED's city at node 20
- Hex (0, -1, 1): Sheep 3 - affects RED's settlement at 11 and city at node 20
- Hex (0, -2, 2): Ore 6 - affects RED's settlement at node 11
- Hex (1, -1, 0): Ore 12 - affects RED's settlement at node 1

The most impactful targets are:
1. Wheat 6 (1, 0, -1) - High probability wheat production on a CITY (triples production loss)
2. Ore 6 (0, -2, 2) - High probability ore that I need and RED has

**Decision Logic:** Since my strategy is ore-wheat focused, and RED has a settlement on the Ore 6 hex, placing the robber there would:
1. Block RED's ore production (critical for their city building)
2. Let me steal a resource from RED
3. Target a high-probability (6) hex
4. Align with my ore-wheat strategy

<plan>
1. Block RED's ORE production to slow their city building
2. Try to obtain ORE myself through trades or robber moves
3. Save resources for my first city upgrade
4. Look for opportunities to expand to better ORE/WHEAT spots
5. Maintain focus on the ORE-WHEAT strategy for cities
</plan>

Option [9]: Move robber to (0, -2, 2) and steal from RED is the optimal move.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 27 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Block RED's ORE production to slow their city building
2. Try to obtain ORE myself through trades or robber moves
3. Save resources for my first city upgrade
4. Look for opportunities to expand to better ORE/WHEAT spots
5. Maintain focus on the ORE-WHEAT strategy for cities
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis for Turn 27

Let me analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action to take.

## Game State Assessment

### Victory Points:
- RED: 4/10 points (2 settlements + 1 city)
- BLUE (me): 2/10 points (2 settlements)

### My Resources:
- 1 BRICK, 2 SHEEP, 2 WHEAT, 1 ORE

### Current Board Position:
- RED has a strong position with a city producing valuable resources
- I have good WHEAT production but limited ORE
- The robber is currently on an ORE hex (0, -2, 2) with value 6, blocking a high-value production

## Action Options

I only have two available actions:
1. End my turn
2. Buy a development card (costs 1 SHEEP + 1 WHEAT + 1 ORE)

Buying a development card would use:
- 1 of my 2 SHEEP
- 1 of my 2 WHEAT
- My only ORE

I need to decide if the potential benefits of a development card outweigh saving these resources for future use.

## Development Card Benefits:
1. Could be a Victory Point card (immediate hidden progress)
2. Could be a Knight to move the robber and possibly get Largest Army (2VP)
3. Could be a Year of Plenty or Monopoly to gain resources strategically

## Strategic Considerations:
- I'm following an ore-wheat strategy focused on city building
- I currently have 1 ORE, which is essential for city building
- RED is ahead with 4VP and has a city already
- I need to accelerate my progress toward cities

<plan>
1. Buy a development card now to potentially get a VP card or Knight
2. If I get a Knight, use it to move the robber from the ore hex and target RED's resources
3. Continue saving resources for my first city upgrade (need 3 ORE + 2 WHEAT total)
4. Prioritize trading or production of additional ORE
5. Maintain focus on the ORE-WHEAT strategy for cities
</plan>

Since I'm following the ore-wheat city-focused strategy, buying a development card is actually aligned with the strategy when I have excess sheep (which I do). The development card could give me:
- A potential Victory Point
- A Knight to move the robber and potentially steal resources
- A Year of Plenty or Monopoly to help get resources for a city

For the ore-wheat strategy, development cards are a key component when you have extra sheep and can't immediately build a city.

Therefore, I should buy a development card.

# Game Analysis for Turn 29

Let me analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action for my ore-wheat strategy.

## Current Game State
- I have 2 VP from my 2 settlements
- RED has 4 VP (3 buildings = 4 VP)
- I have 1 BRICK, 1 SHEEP, and 2 WHEAT resources
- I have 1 KNIGHT development card
- The robber is currently on a valuable ORE hex (0, -2, 2) with production number 6

## Resource Analysis
- The robber is blocking an ore hex with a high production value (6)
- RED has 3 buildings with strong production (including a city)
- I need ore for my city upgrade strategy, but the robber is blocking a key ore hex

## Available Actions
0. Play Knight card - Move the robber and steal a resource
1. Roll the dice

## Strategic Considerations
1. Playing the Knight would:
   - Move the robber from the ore hex
   - Allow me to steal a resource from RED (potentially ore/wheat)
   - Contribute toward largest army (need 3 knights total)

2. Rolling the dice would:
   - Potentially get more resources
   - But the robber would remain on the ore hex

## Decision Logic
The robber on the ore hex is a major obstacle to my ore-wheat strategy. Playing the Knight now would:
1. Unblock ore production (critical for my city strategy)
2. Let me steal a resource from RED (who has 4 cards)
3. Start building toward largest army (2 VP)

<plan>
1. Play Knight to move the robber from the ore hex
2. Target RED's settlements/city when placing the robber
3. Continue saving resources for my first city upgrade
4. Focus on acquiring ore now that production will be unblocked
5. Maintain the ore-wheat strategy for city development
</plan>

Given my ore-wheat strategy, unblocking ore production is critical, and playing the Knight now is clearly the optimal move.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 29 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Play Knight to move the robber from the ore hex
2. Target RED's settlements/city when placing the robber
3. Continue saving resources for my first city upgrade

# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to place the robber optimally based on the ore-wheat strategy and current game state.

## Current Game Assessment:
- RED player is leading with 4 VP (including a city) vs. my 2 VP
- I have 1 brick, 1 sheep, 2 wheat resources
- The robber is currently on hex (0, -2, 2), which is an ore hex with a 6 value (high probability)
- I need to prioritize ore and wheat production for my city-focused strategy

## Priority Targets Analysis:
1. **Block RED's highest value hex:** RED has a city at node 20 producing from a wheat 6 hex and wood 8 hex - these are high value targets
2. **Steal valuable resources:** RED has 4 cards, likely including resources I need
3. **Protect my own production:** Ensure I don't block my own resources

## Examining Hex Options:
- **Action 6:** Move to (1, 0, -1) = wheat 6 hex that RED's city at node 20 produces from
- **Action 15:** Move to (1, 1, -2) = wood 8 hex that RED's city at node 20 produces from
- **Action 0:** Move to (0, 0, 0) = wood 9 hex that RED's settlement at node 1 produces from

The most strategic action is to target RED's city production. Since I'm focusing on an ore-wheat strategy, I want to block RED's wheat production while potentially stealing resources I need.

<plan>
1. Move robber to hex (1, 0, -1) to block RED's wheat 6 production from their city
2. Focus on saving ore for city upgrades - get the robber off my ore production
3. Consider building a road toward more ore production
4. Continue with the ore-wheat focus to build my first city
</plan>

Placing the robber on hex (1, 0, -1) is optimal because:
- It blocks a high-probability wheat 6 hex from RED's city
- It allows me to steal from RED, potentially getting resources I need
- It aligns with my ore-wheat strategy by limiting RED's city production
- This hex connects to RED's city, maximizing impact by blocking a 6 value resource

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan - Turn 31

I need to evaluate my position carefully and make the best strategic move following my ore-wheat strategy.

## Current Game Position:
- I have 2 VP (2 settlements)
- RED has 4 VP (2 settlements + 1 city)
- I have 2 BRICK, 1 SHEEP, 4 WHEAT resources
- My settlements are on nodes 26 (produces sheep) and 23 (produces wheat, wheat, brick)
- The robber is on hex (1, 0, -1), which is a wheat 6 hex

## Resource Evaluation:
- I have good wheat production (2 hexes)
- I lack consistent ore production
- I have some brick production from my settlement at node 23
- I'm missing wood production entirely

## Analysis of Available Actions:
1. End Turn [0]
2. Maritime Trade Options [1-4]: Trading 4 WHEAT for other resources

Looking at my current plan:
1. Move robber to block RED's wheat 6 production - this is already done as the robber is on (1, 0, -1)
2. Focus on saving ore for city upgrades - I currently have no ore
3. Consider road building toward ore - I need ore and wood for expansion

## Strategic Considerations:
- I need ORE urgently for my city-focused strategy
- I have excess wheat (4) which could be traded at a poor 4:1 ratio
- Looking at the board, I should try to acquire ORE to progress toward city building

Since I can't afford to build anything directly (no ore for city, no wood for roads/settlements), my best option is to trade for resources I need most. Given my ore-wheat strategy, I need ore urgently.

<plan>
1. Trade wheat for ore to start accumulating resources for city building
2. Next turns: aim to get wood for road building toward good ore production
3. Once I have enough ore and wheat, upgrade one of my settlements to a city
4. Continue blocking RED's wheat production with the robber
</plan>

Since I have 4 wheat and need ore desperately for my city-building strategy, I'll trade 4 wheat for 1 ore using the maritime trade option.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 53 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Trade wheat for ore to start accumulating resources for city building
2. Next turns: aim to get wood for road building toward good ore production
3. Once I have enough ore and wheat, upgrade one of my settlements to a city
4. Continue blocking RED's wheat production with the robber
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.
  To adjust your plan, provide a NEW PLAN in your reasoning with <plan>your new plan</plan>

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze the current game state and determine the optimal move for our ore-wheat strategy:

## Game State Assessment

1. **Victory Point Gap**: RED has 9/10 VP (close to winning), we have only 2/10 VP
2. **Resources**: We have 2 brick, 2 sheep, 4 wheat, 0 ore, 0 wood
3. **Production**: We have good wheat production (6, 9) and some brick (5), but no ore
4. **Position**: RED is dominant with 5 buildings and longest road, controlling key resources

## Current Issues
- We urgently need ore for city upgrades (core of ore-wheat strategy)
- RED is one point away from winning, so time is critical
- We have no settlements near ore hexes

## Action Analysis

**Option 0: End Turn**
- Wastes our wheat resources
- Makes no progress toward our strategy
- Allows RED to potentially win next turn

**Maritime Trade Options (1-4)**:
- We have 4 wheat, which allows for a 4:1 trade with the bank
- We need both ore and wood most urgently:
  - Ore: Needed for city upgrades and development cards
  - Wood: Needed for roads to expand toward ore production

Looking at our resources and the board:
- We have no ore production at all, making it our biggest priority 
- We need to build toward good ore producing hexes
- We need to convert our excess wheat into something immediately useful

Since our current plan emphasizes accumulating ore for city building, and we have no ore production, trading for ore is the most logical step.

<plan>
1. Trade wheat for ore to start accumulating resources for city upgrades
2. Next turn, focus on getting wood to build roads toward ore hexes (8)
3. Build roads toward node 18 area to access ore production
4. Continue collecting resources for city upgrades
5. Try to block RED's production with robber whenever possible
</plan>

The optimal action is to trade 4 wheat for 1 ore via maritime trade.

# Game Analysis for Robber Placement

I need to analyze the best position for the robber to maximize my chances of winning against RED, who is at 9 VP and close to victory.

## Current Game State
- RED: 9/10 VP (close to winning), has 2 cities, 3 settlements, longest road
- BLUE (me): 2/10 VP, only 2 settlements, need significant progress
- RED has 2 hidden resources
- I need to focus on my ore-wheat strategy for city upgrades

## Robber Placement Priorities:
1. Disrupt RED's high-value production, especially ore and wheat
2. Target hexes where RED has cities for maximum impact
3. Steal valuable resources (ore/wheat preferred)
4. Avoid blocking my own resource production

## Analyzing RED's Most Valuable Hexes:
- Node 20 (city): Produces 🐑3, 🌾6 (wheat), 🌲8
- Node 11 (settlement): Produces 🐑3, ⛏️6 (ore), 🧱11
- Node 1 (city): Produces 🌲9, ⛏️12 (ore), 🌾6 (wheat)
- Node 18 (settlement): Produces 🌲4, ⛏️8 (ore), 🐑5

The highest-value hexes for RED are:
- Ore 6 (⭐⭐⭐) at (0, -2, 2) - hex connected to settlement 11
- Ore 8 (⭐⭐⭐) at (-2, 2, 0) - hex connected to settlement 18
- Wheat 6 (⭐⭐⭐) at (1, 0, -1) - hex connected to city 1 and 20

## Best Robber Options:
- Option 9: Move robber to (0, -2, 2) - blocks RED's ore 6 production and steals from RED
- Option 13: Move robber to (-2, 2, 0) - blocks RED's ore 8 production and steals from RED
- Option 6: Move robber to (1, 0, -1) - blocks RED's wheat 6 production and steals from RED

Since RED is at 9 VP and following my ore-wheat strategy, I should prioritize blocking RED's ore production. Between options 9 and 13, the ore 6 hex with option 9 seems more impactful as it affects a higher probability hex (6 vs 8).

<plan>
1. Block RED's ore production to slow them down
2. Continue collecting resources for city upgrades 
3. Build roads toward node 18 area to access ore production
4. Trade for ore/wheat whenever possible
5. Focus on upgrading settlements to cities
</plan>

I choose to move the robber to the ore 6 hex to block RED's high-probability ore production and potentially steal a valuable resource.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 57 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Block RED's ore production to slow them down
2. Continue collecting resources for city upgrades 
3. Build roads toward node 18 area to access ore production
4. Trade for ore/wheat whenever possible
5. Focus on upgrading settlements to cities
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze my current situation:

## Victory Points
- I have only 2 VP (from 2 settlements)
- RED has 9 VP (needs just 1 more to win)

## My Resources
- 2 🧱 BRICK
- 2 🐑 SHEEP
- 1 🌾 WHEAT
- 2 ⛏️ ORE
- Total: 7 cards

## Available Actions
- [0] End turn
- [1] Buy a development card (costs 1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE)

## Strategic Assessment

RED is at 9 VP and very close to winning. They have:
- 3 settlements (3 VP) 
- 2 cities (4 VP)
- Longest Road (2 VP)

I'm far behind with only 2 VP. My options are limited this turn:

1. **Buy a development card**: This could give me a knight (to protect against robber and build toward largest army), a VP card (hidden until I win), or a progress card. This is my only productive move.

2. **End turn**: This wastes an opportunity to make progress.

Given that RED is one point away from winning, I need to make every action count. A development card could be crucial - it might be a Victory Point card, or a knight to help build toward Largest Army. Even if it's a progress card, it could help me in future turns.

Also, if I don't buy the development card, I'll be holding 7 cards and risk losing half if a 7 is rolled on the next turn.

<plan>
1. Buy development card this turn to reduce hand size and possibly get a VP card or knight
2. Focus on upgrading one settlement to a city next (need 3 ore + 2 wheat)
3. Target RED's ore production with robber when possible
4. Build toward node 18 area for better ore access
5. Continue ore-wheat strategy for city upgrades

# Game State Analysis

I need to carefully consider whether to play my Road Building development card now or roll the dice first.

## Current Situation:
- I have 2 VP (from settlements)
- RED has 9 VP (almost winning)
- I have 2 brick, 2 sheep, and 1 ore
- I have a Road Building card
- I've played 1 Knight card previously

## Option Analysis:

### Option 0: Play Road Building
- Pros: 
  - Can immediately build 2 roads without spending brick/wood
  - Could start expanding toward node 18 area (good ore hex)
  - Removes card from hand so it can't be stolen
- Cons:
  - If I roll first, I might get resources that would be more immediately useful
  - Road Building has more value when I'm ready for immediate settlement placement

### Option 1: Roll Dice
- Pros:
  - Could gain resources to possibly build a city (need 2 more ore, 2 wheat) or settlement
  - After seeing what resources I get, I can make a more informed decision
  - Can still play Road Building after rolling if that remains the best option
- Cons:
  - Risk of 7 causing me to discard (though I only have 5 cards)

## Strategic Considerations:
- RED is at 9 VP and could win next turn
- I need to focus on the ore-wheat strategy for building cities
- My current plan emphasizes buying a development card, but I don't have enough wheat (need 1 more)
- Building toward node 18 would improve ore access

The optimal ore-wheat strategy requires me to gather more resources before I can build a city. Rolling first gives me a chance to gain those resources, and I can still play Road Building afterward if needed.

<plan>
1. Roll dice to gather more resources
2. If I gain wheat, buy a development card to reduce hand size and potentially get VP/Knight
3. Otherwise, use Road Building to expand toward better ore access (node 18 area)
4. Target upgrading settlements to cities as soon as I gather 3 ore & 2 wheat
5. Continue moving robber to disrupt RED's ore production
</plan>

Given these considerations, I should roll first to see what resources I get, then decide my next action.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 59 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Roll dice to gather more resources
2. If I gain wheat, buy a development card to reduce hand size and potentially get VP/Knight
3. Otherwise, use Road Building to expand toward better ore access (node 18 area)
4. Target upgrading settlements to cities as soon as I gather 3 ore & 2 wheat
5. Continue moving robber to disrupt RED's ore production

# Game Analysis: Settlers of Catan Turn 59

Let me analyze the current game state and determine the best action to take.

## Current Situation
- I have 2 points (2 settlements) vs RED's 9 points
- Resources: 2 brick, 2 sheep, 1 ore
- Development Cards: 1 Road Building card
- RED is just 1 point away from winning

## Game State Assessment
RED is clearly dominating with 9 points, having both cities and the longest road bonus. I'm far behind with only 2 points from my settlements. 

## Available Actions
I have two options:
1. [0] Play Road Building card - Build two roads for free
2. [1] End my turn

## Decision Analysis

Looking at my current plan, I was going to roll dice to gather resources. However, the prompt indicates I've already rolled the dice and now need to decide what to do with what I have.

If I end my turn now, I make no progress. RED is at 9 points and will likely win on their next turn.

If I play my Road Building card, I can build two free roads, which helps me in several ways:
1. Makes progress toward potentially claiming Longest Road (though this is a longer-term goal)
2. Allows me to expand toward better resource production locations
3. Possibly block RED from further expansion

Looking at the board, I should use Road Building to extend toward better ore production since that's my weakest resource currently, and I need it for city upgrades (core of ore-wheat strategy).

The current robber is on an ore hex (0,-2,2) with a value of 6, which shows I've been trying to block RED's ore production - good strategy.

<plan>
1. Use Road Building card to expand toward node 18 area for better ore access
2. Continue blocking RED's ore production with robber
3. Focus on upgrading to cities as soon as I gather enough ore and wheat
4. Try to draw development cards whenever possible for VP and knights
5. Work toward longest road as a secondary goal
</plan>

Since I need to make progress and RED is close to winning, using my Road Building card now is clearly the better option compared to ending my turn with no action.

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

I need to carefully analyze my position and make the best move for my ore-wheat strategy.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have only 2 VP (from 2 settlements)
- My opponent RED has 9 VP (3 settlements + 2 cities + longest road) and is one point away from winning
- I have 2 brick, 2 sheep, and 1 ore
- I have no wood, which I need for road building
- The robber is currently on a valuable ore hex (6), blocking important production

## Resource Production Analysis
- My settlements are at:
  - Node 26: only produces sheep (10) - low probability
  - Node 23: produces wheat (6, 9) and brick (5) - good wheat production
- I'm critically lacking ore and wood production
- RED has excellent production of ore (8), wheat (6) and wood (8, 9)

## Available Road Building Options
I have 6 options to build roads, but I need wood+brick which I don't fully have:
- Option 0: Road at (23, 52) - extends toward wheat (9) hex
- Option 1: Road at (26, 27) - extends toward sheep (10) hex
- Option 2: Road at (22, 23) - connects toward wheat (6, 9) area
- Option 3: Road at (24, 25) - extends toward wood port
- Option 4: Road at (6, 7) - extends toward ore (12) and sheep (10)
- Option 5: Road at (1, 6) - extends toward central node

## Strategic Considerations
1. I'm far behind and need to improve my position quickly
2. I need better ore production for my city-focused strategy
3. I need to use my development cards effectively
4. RED is close to winning, so I need to disrupt their progress

<plan>
1. I cannot build roads immediately due to lack of wood
2. Focus on resource acquisition - I need ore/wheat for city upgrades or development cards
3. When I get wood, expand toward better ore production locations
4. Use the robber strategically to block RED's strong production
5. Buy development cards when possible for knights and potential VP
6. Try to break RED's longest road if opportunity arises
</plan>

Since I don't have the resources to build a road (missing wood), and none of the options allow me to build settlements or cities, I need to pass this turn. 

However, the prompt doesn't show a "pass turn" option. Looking at the options again, I'm being asked to select a road location even though I can't build it this turn. This must be for planning purposes.

The most strategic direction to expand would be option 0 (road at edge 23, 52) as it heads toward the wheat (9) hex and potentially gives access to a general 3:1 port at node 52. This improves my wheat production and trading flexibility.

\boxed{0}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 59 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. I cannot build roads immediately due to lack of wood
2. Focus on resource acquisition - I need ore/wheat for city upgrades or development cards
3. When I get wood, expand toward better ore production locations
4. Use the robber strategically to block RED's strong production
5. Buy development cards when possible for knights and potential VP
6. Try to break RED's longest road if opportunity arises

# Game State Analysis

I need to analyze my current situation thoroughly to make the best move:

## Victory Point Status
- RED: 9/10 points - just 1 point away from winning
- BLUE (me): 2/10 points - far behind

## My Resources
- 2 BRICK, 2 SHEEP, 1 ORE
- Notably missing WOOD and WHEAT

## Production Analysis
- My settlements produce BRICK, SHEEP, WHEAT, but limited ORE
- RED has excellent production with 2 cities and 3 settlements
- RED controls the longest road (+2 VP)

## Immediate Possibilities
Since I don't have WOOD, I can't build any roads right now. None of the actions 0-6 are possible at this moment.

## Strategic Situation
RED is one point away from winning, while I'm far behind. My immediate goal should be disrupting RED while improving my position. I need to focus on:
1. Acquiring resources effectively
2. Planning for my next builds when resources become available
3. Using the robber strategically

<plan>
1. Use the robber strategically to slow RED's progress - target high-value hexes
2. Trade at ports when possible to get needed resources (especially wood)
3. When I get wood, build roads toward ore-producing areas
4. Focus on upgrading one settlement to a city ASAP
5. Consider buying development cards for knights and potential VP
</plan>

Since none of the action options (0-6) are actually valid due to my lack of wood resources, and reviewing the game state shows I must be in the trading or ending my turn phase, I need to select the appropriate action to end my turn.

However, I notice that the prompt is asking me to select from the road building options 0-6, despite not having the required resources. This indicates we might be in a special case where I'm being asked which road I would build if I could.

Looking at the options strategically:
- Option #1 (26, 27) extends toward a sheep hex (already have sheep)
- Option #2 (22, 23) doesn't create new opportunities
- Option #5 (51, 52) leads toward a wheat port which could be useful
- Option #3 (6, 7) expands toward ore (12) and sheep (10) - ore being critical
- Option #4 (24, 25) moves toward the wood port I already have access to

Given I'm following an ore-wheat strategy and need to focus on city building, option #3 (build road at edge 6, 7) would be most strategic as it expands toward an ore hex, which I critically need for my strategy.

# Game Analysis for Blue Player

I'll analyze the current game state and make the best decision based on the ore-wheat strategy.

## Current Situation Assessment:
- I have only 2 victory points (from 2 settlements)
- RED has 9 points and is about to win
- I have: 3 🧱BRICK, 2 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE
- My settlements produce: 
  * Node 26: 🐑10 (low probability)
  * Node 23: 🌾6 (excellent), 🌾9 (good), 🧱5 (good)
- I have a 2:1 wood port but no wood production
- The robber is on ore(6), which is a high-value hex

## Available Actions:
1. Buy a development card (1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE)
2. End turn

## Strategic Considerations:

Looking at my resources and position:
- I need to catch up quickly as RED is at 9 points
- Development cards could give me VP cards, knights (for largest army), or helpful action cards
- I already have all the resources needed for a development card
- I don't have resources for other builds this turn
- A development card could potentially be a victory point card
- Knights could help build toward largest army (though I'd need 2 more)
- Action cards (Year of Plenty, Monopoly) could accelerate my progress

<plan>
1. Buy development card this turn
2. Continue to build toward a city with my next ore/wheat resources
3. Move the robber off the ore hex when possible
4. Focus on building roads toward ore-producing areas
5. Use the wood port strategically when I get wood
</plan>

Since RED is about to win with 9 points, and I only have 2 points, I need to make a bold move. A development card is my only viable option this turn. It could be a victory point card, knight, or action card - all of which would help my position.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 0 | Player: BLUE | Action: BUILD_INITIAL_SETTLEMENT

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Buy development card this turn
2. Continue to build toward a city with my next ore/wheat resources
3. Move the robber off the ore hex when possible
4. Focus on building roads toward ore-producing areas
5. Use the wood port strategically when I get wood
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.
  To adjust your plan, provide a NEW PLAN in your reasoning with <plan>your new plan</plan>

# Initial Settlement Analysis

I'm placing my first settlement on the board, which is a critical strategic decision. I need to analyze the board to find the optimal location focusing on the ore-wheat strategy.

- High value numbers (6-8): ⛏️6, 🌲6, 🐑8, 🐑8
- Good value numbers (5-9): 🧱5, 🌾5, 🧱9, 🌾9
- Low value numbers (2-4, 10-12): ⛏️3, 🌲4, 🌾4, 🌲10, etc.
- The robber is currently on a desert hex (0, -2, 2)

## Best Node Analysis
Let me evaluate nodes at major resource intersections, especially those with ore and wheat:

### Ore-Wheat Combination Nodes:
- Node 13: ⛏️6 + ⛏️3 + 🌾11 (Very strong ore production with wheat)
- Node 14: ⛏️6 + 🌾11 + 🌾5 (Good mix of ore and wheat)
- Node 15: 🌾11 + 🌾5 + 🌲4 (Great wheat but minimal diversity)

### Highest Pip Count Nodes:
- Node 8: 🧱9 + 🌲6 + 🐑8 (High pip count with good diversity)
- Node 13: ⛏️6 + ⛏️3 + 🌾11 (Strong ore focus with wheat)
- Node 7: 🌲6 + 🐑8 + 🧱5 (Good pip count with diversity)

### Port Considerations:
- Node 38/39 is near the ore port
- Node 25/26 is near the wheat port
- These could be strategic for later expansion

## Decision Making

For my first settlement, I need to prioritize:
1. High probability ore and wheat
2. Good pip count (probability dots)
3. Resource diversity for early game flexibility
4. Future expansion potential

Node 13 stands out as exceptional for the ore-wheat strategy:
- Access to ⛏️6 (high value ore) + ⛏️3 (additional ore) + 🌾11 (wheat)
- Strong focus on ore which is critical for cities
- Has wheat for development cards and cities
- Near the wood port for trading flexibility
- Position allows expansion toward more wheat hexes

This aligns perfectly with the ore-wheat strategy and gives me a strong foundation for city upgrades later.

<plan>
1. Initial settlement at node 13 to secure strong ore production with wheat
2. Second settlement on a complementary location with different resources (sheep, wood, brick)
3. Early focus on upgrading node 13 to a city to double ore production
4. Build only essential roads and settlements toward strategic resources
5. Use wood port for efficient trading when needed
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

RESPONSE:
# Initial Road Placement Analysis

I need to place my first road strategically to support my initial settlement at node 13, which is an excellent position with strong ore production (a key resource for my city-focused strategy).

Let me analyze each available road option:

## Option [0]: Build road at edge (13, 14)
- Direction: Leads northeast toward nodes 14, 15, etc.
- Nearby resources: Wheat 5, Ore 6
- Future expansion: Could access ore port (38, 39) in the long term
- Port access: Potential path to ore port

## Option [1]: Build road at edge (12, 13)
- Direction: Leads northwest toward nodes 12, 3, etc.
- Nearby resources: Wood 10, Wheat 4
- Future expansion: Could reach wheat/sheep areas
- Port access: Less direct path to ports

## Option [2]: Build road at edge (13, 34)
- Direction: Leads south toward nodes 34, 35, etc.
- Nearby resources: Ore 6 (already have)
- Future expansion: Direct path to wood port (35, 36)
- Port access: Most direct path to wood port

## Strategic Evaluation

For the ore-wheat strategy, I need to:
1. Prepare for my second settlement placement (next turn)
2. Plan for future expansion toward valuable resources
3. Consider port access for efficient trading

The most logical choice is Option [2] leading to edge (13, 34) because:
- It provides the most direct path to the wood port (35, 36), which will be valuable for trading excess wood for resources needed for city building
- It extends southward, creating distance from my first settlement which is ideal for maximizing board coverage
- It opens potential settlement spots that would access different resources than my current settlement

<plan>
1. Place first road toward wood port (edge 13, 34)
2. For second settlement, look for a location with brick, wood and sheep access
3. Focus on upgrading node 13 to a city early to maximize ore production
4. Use wood port efficiently to trade for ore/wheat when needed
5. Develop toward ore port as a secondary objective
</plan>

# Analyzing Second Initial Settlement Placement

I need to carefully evaluate all possible placement options for my second initial settlement to implement an optimal ore-wheat strategy. This is a crucial decision as I won't have another chance to freely place a settlement.

## Current Assessment
- My first settlement is at node 13 with excellent ore production (3 and 6) and wheat (11) - this aligns well with my ore-wheat strategy
- I've placed my first road toward the wood port at edge (13, 34)
- RED has settlements at nodes 7 and 1, giving them access to sheep(8), wood(6), brick(5), wheat(4), and ore(11)

## Resource Analysis
For my ore-wheat strategy, I need to:
1. Ensure good access to both ORE and WHEAT (priority)
2. Secure BRICK and WOOD for early expansion
3. Get some SHEEP for development cards

## Settlement Evaluation Criteria
1. Resource diversity (especially finding brick & wood since I already have ore & wheat)
2. High probability numbers (pip count)
3. Future expansion potential
4. Port access where beneficial
5. Avoid being blocked by RED

## Top Contender Analysis

Looking at node 14:
- Access to ore(6), wheat(5), and wood(4)
- Connected to ore port
- Good expansion potential along the coast
- Pip counts: 5 dots (ore 6) + 4 dots (wheat 5) + 1 dot (wood 4) = 10 pips
- 🔴 Excellent ore-wheat combo with good numbers

Looking at node 15:
- Access to wheat(5), wood(4), wheat(11)
- Pip counts: 4 dots (wheat 5) + 2 dots (wheat 11) + 1 dot (wood 4) = 7 pips
- Lacks resource diversity (double wheat)

Looking at node 37:
- Access to ore(6), wheat(5)
- Connected to ore port
- Pip counts: 5 dots (ore 6) + 4 dots (wheat 5) = 9 pips
- Lacks resource diversity (missing brick, wood, sheep)

Looking at node 27:
- Access to brick(9), wood(6)
- Access to wheat port
- Pip counts: 4 dots (brick 9) + 5 dots (wood 6) = 9 pips
- Provides brick and wood needed for expansion

Looking at node 26:
- Access to wood(6) and wheat port
- Pip count: 5 dots (wood 6) = 5 pips
- Limited resources despite port access

## Decision
Node 14 is clearly the strongest choice for my ore-wheat strategy:
1. Great ore & wheat production (high probability numbers)
2. Wood access for expansion
3. Ore port access (critical for my strategy)
4. Good coastal position for expansion
5. Complements my first settlement by securing additional wheat, ore and adding wood

<plan>
1. Place second settlement at node 14 for ore, wheat and wood access
2. Use road at (14, 15) to expand toward node 15 for additional wheat production
3. Focus on upgrading nodes 13 and 14 to cities early
4. Use ore port efficiently when I have excess ore
5. Target brick as my weakness - trade for it when needed
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 2 | Player: BLUE | Action: BUILD_INITIAL_ROAD

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Place second settlement at node 14 for ore, wheat and wood access
2. Use road at (14, 15) to expand toward node 15 for additional wheat production
3. Focus on upgrading nodes 13 and 14 to cities early
4. Use ore port efficiently when I have excess ore
5. Target brick as my weakness - trade for it when needed
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

❓ Select action by number (0-2):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the game state and evaluate my options for placing my initial road while considering my overall strategy.

First, let me understand my current position:
- I have two settlements already placed:
  1. Node 13 (produces ore from two hexes plus wheat)
  2. Node 39 (produces wheat and sheep) - with access to the 2:1 ore port

My current resources are 1 sheep and 1 wheat.

Let me examine my road-building options:
[0] Edge (38, 39) - Extends from my settlement at node 39 toward the ore port I already have access to.
[1] Edge (17, 39) - Extends from my settlement at node 39 toward node 17, which connects to sheep and wood hexes.
[2] Edge (39, 41) - Extends from my settlement at node 39 toward node 41, which is on a sheep hex.

Looking at the potential future expansion:
- Edge (38, 39) doesn't open up any valuable new settlement spots, as I already have the ore port.
- Edge (17, 39) moves toward node 17, which connects to wood, wheat and sheep hexes.
- Edge (39, 41) moves toward potential sheep production, which is less valuable for my ore-wheat strategy.

Since this is my initial road placement (no resource cost), I should position it for optimal future expansion. Edge (17, 39) offers the best strategic value as it:
1. Moves toward wood production (which I'll need for roads to expand)
2. Creates path to potential future settlement spots
3. Follows my plan to develop toward additional wheat production

<plan>
1. Place initial road at edge (17, 39) to expand toward additional resources
2. Focus on acquiring brick and wood to build roads toward node 15 for additional wheat
3. Prioritize upgrading nodes 13 and 14 to cities for increased ore and wheat production
4. Use the ore port to trade excess ore efficiently
5. Continue expanding based on resource needs while focusing on city upgrades
</plan>

This road placement aligns with my strategy to secure more resource production while working toward city upgrades. It gives me flexibility for future expansion while maintaining focus on my ore-wheat strategy.

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and my available options carefully.

## Current Resources
- 2 Sheep, 3 Wheat, 1 Ore

## Current Board Position
- I have settlements at nodes 13 and 39
- Node 13 produces ore (3 and 6), wheat (11)
- Node 39 produces wheat (5) and sheep (3)
- I have access to 2:1 ore port

## Victory Point Status
- I have 2 VP (from 2 settlements)
- Opponent has 2 VP (from 2 settlements)
- Game goal is 10 VP

## Strategic Assessment
1. I'm pursuing an ore-wheat strategy, which means I need to prioritize city upgrades
2. With my current resources (2 sheep, 3 wheat, 1 ore), I can buy a development card (costs 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore)
3. I cannot build a city (needs 3 ore, 2 wheat) or a settlement (needs 1 brick, 1 wood, 1 wheat, 1 sheep)

## Options Analysis
- Option 0: End turn
  - No immediate gain
  - Risk: Opponent continues advancing, I waste my turn
  - Risk: Holding cards makes me vulnerable to a 7 roll

- Option 1: Buy development card
  - Potential benefits:
    - Could be a Victory Point card (immediate hidden VP)
    - Could be a Knight (useful for robber control, largest army)
    - Could be a Progress card (Road Building, Year of Plenty, Monopoly)
  - Reduces my hand size to avoid losing cards on a 7 roll
  - Aligns with the ore-wheat strategy by potentially providing hidden VP or knights

## Decision Logic
Since I can't build a city or settlement with my current resources, and I don't want to waste my turn, buying a development card is the most strategic action. Development cards are valuable in the ore-wheat strategy as they can provide hidden VP, knight cards for largest army (2 VP), or helpful progress cards. This also reduces my hand size from 6 to 3 cards, protecting me from the 7 roll.

<plan>
1. Buy development card to potentially gain VP, knights, or helpful progress cards
2. Continue collecting ore and wheat for city upgrades
3. Target upgrading node 13 to a city first (high ore production)
4. Use ore port when necessary to convert excess ore
5. Look for opportunities to expand to additional wheat production
</plan>

\boxed{1}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 10 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Buy development card to potentially gain VP, knights, or helpful progress cards
2. Continue collecting ore and wheat for city upgrades
3. Target upgrading node 13 to a city first (high ore production)
4. Use ore port when necessary to convert excess ore
5. Look for opportunities to expand to additional wheat production
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze my options for the most effective action in this turn:

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 2 VP (from 2 settlements)
- Resources: 1 sheep, 2 wheat
- Development cards: 1 Monopoly card
- Red player also has 2 VP
- I have access to the 2:1 ore port at node 39
- The robber is on (0, -2, 2) - a desert hex, not affecting any resource production

## My Resource Production
- Settlement at node 13: Produces wheat(11), ore(3), and ore(6) - excellent ore and wheat production
- Settlement at node 39: Produces wheat(5) and sheep(3) - more wheat production

## Options Analysis

I need to decide whether to use my Monopoly card now or roll the dice:

### Option: Play Monopoly Card
The Monopoly card lets me take all of one resource type from other players. Based on my strategy:
- Ore and wheat are my priority resources for city upgrades (2 ore + 3 wheat per city)
- I already have 2 wheat and Red likely has collected some resources
- Red's settlements produce wheat, sheep, brick, wood, and ore

The most valuable resources to monopolize would be:
- **Ore**: Critical for city upgrades and I need more
- **Wheat**: I need 1 more for a city upgrade if I get enough ore

### Option: Roll the Dice
If I roll, I could collect more resources naturally and save the Monopoly card for a more strategic moment. However, I currently don't have enough resources for any meaningful build regardless of what I roll.

## Decision Logic

1. My ore-wheat strategy focuses on quick city upgrades
2. I already have 2 wheat, so I need 1 more wheat and 2 ore for a city
3. Red likely has collected some ore from their settlement at node 1
4. Playing Monopoly now for ore could potentially get me closer to a city upgrade
5. If I roll first, I risk Red using their resources before I can monopolize them

<plan>
1. Use Monopoly to collect all ore from opponents
2. Focus on upgrading node 13 to a city (high ore production)
3. Use ore port to convert excess ore when needed
4. Continue developing toward wheat port (nodes 25-26) for more efficient wheat trading
5. Look for opportunities to block Red's expansion
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I will play the Monopoly card targeting ore to maximize my chances of upgrading to a city quickly.

# Game Analysis

Let me thoroughly analyze the current game state and my options to determine the optimal move for the ore-wheat strategy.

## Game State Assessment
- I have 2 VP from my 2 settlements
- Red also has 2 VP from 2 settlements, plus a hidden development card
- I have 1 🐑, 2 🌾, 1 ⛏️ resources
- I've already played a Monopoly card
- I'm executing an ore-wheat focused strategy
- Current available actions: End turn (0) or Buy development card (1)

## Resources Analysis
- I have exactly enough resources to buy a development card (1 🐑, 1 🌾, 1 ⛏️)
- After buying a card, I'd have 1 🌾 left
- My main production is from node 13 with good ore income (⛏️6 is a strong probability)
- Red has good production with 🐑8 (high probability) on two settlements

## Strategic Considerations
1. Development cards provide several benefits:
   - Potential VP card (immediate hidden point)
   - Knight to defend against robber/gain largest army
   - Year of Plenty or Monopoly for resource acceleration
   - All support the ore-wheat city strategy

2. Building nothing this turn:
   - Wastes production potential
   - I may exceed 7 cards after next roll if I produce well
   - No progress toward victory

3. Current plan alignment:
   - My plan mentions city upgrades (especially for node 13)
   - Development cards can help achieve this plan

## Decision Logic
Since I have exactly the resources needed for a development card and no other build options, buying a development card is clearly the optimal choice. This keeps me making progress while potentially gaining:
- A hidden VP (25% chance)
- A knight to protect my ore hex or gain largest army (50% chance)
- A resource acceleration card to help with city upgrades (25% chance)

Any of these outcomes support my ore-wheat city-focused strategy better than ending my turn with no improvement.

<plan>
1. Buy development card this turn
2. Continue focus on upgrading node 13 to city (high ore production)
3. Build road toward wheat port (nodes 25-26) when resources allow
4. Watch for opportunities to block Red's expansion
5. Use knights strategically to protect ore production
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 12 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Buy development card this turn
2. Continue focus on upgrading node 13 to city (high ore production)
3. Build road toward wheat port (nodes 25-26) when resources allow
4. Watch for opportunities to block Red's expansion
5. Use knights strategically to protect ore production
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis: Turn 12 Decision

Let me analyze the current game state to determine the optimal action:

## Current Situation
- I have 2 victory points (2 settlements)
- I have no resources in hand
- I have 1 KNIGHT development card available to play
- The robber is currently on hex (-1, 0, 1), which is a wheat hex with value 11
- This is the beginning of my turn, so I need to decide between playing a knight or rolling the dice

## Robber Impact
- The robber is currently on a wheat 11 hex, which is one of my key production hexes for my settlement at node 13
- My settlement at node 13 produces from ore 3, ore 6, and wheat 11 (currently blocked)
- By playing the knight, I could:
  1. Move the robber off my wheat production
  2. Place it on an opponent's valuable hex
  3. Potentially steal a resource from the opponent

## Resource Analysis
- I currently have no resources
- My ore-wheat strategy requires me to accumulate these resources quickly
- Having the robber on my wheat 11 hex significantly hampers my production capability
- I need to build toward cities, which require ore and wheat

## Decision Logic
Playing the knight now would:
- Unblock my wheat 11 production immediately
- Allow me to place the robber on the opponent's high-value hex (likely sheep 8 or wood 6)
- Potentially steal one of their resources
- This will accelerate my ability to gather resources for a city upgrade

Rolling the dice first would:
- Result in no wheat production if 11 is rolled (due to robber)
- Miss an opportunity to immediately improve my position

<plan>
1. Play knight to move robber off wheat 11 hex and onto Red's sheep 8 hex
2. Focus on gathering resources for upgrading node 13 to a city
3. Build road toward wheat port (nodes 25-26) when resources allow
4. Continue to limit Red's expansion with strategic robber placement
5. Save future development cards for largest army or victory points
</plan>

The most effective action is to play the knight card immediately to unblock my critical wheat production and potentially gain a resource.

# Game State Analysis

I'm playing a knight card which lets me move the robber. This is a strategic opportunity to disrupt my opponent while protecting my own production.

## Current Game State:
- I have 2 settlements (nodes 13 and 39)
- Red has 2 settlements (nodes 7 and 1)
- The robber is on the wheat 11 hex (-1, 0, 1) which is connected to my settlement at node 13
- I currently have no resources
- Red has 2 hidden resource cards
- We're tied at 2 VP each

## Robber Placement Strategy Analysis:

My goal is to maximize my chances of gaining resources while disrupting Red's key production. Looking at Red's settlements:

1. Red's settlement at node 7 produces from:
   - Sheep 8 (high probability)
   - Wood 6 (high probability)
   - Brick 5 (good probability)

2. Red's settlement at node 1 produces from:
   - Wheat 4 (low probability)
   - Sheep 8 (high probability)
   - Ore 11 (low probability)

The highest value options for robber placement are:
- Option [1]: Move to (1, -1, 0) - Red's Sheep 8 hex with probability 5 - This blocks production from BOTH of Red's settlements
- Option [6]: Move to (2, -2, 0) - Red's Wood 6 hex with probability 5
- Option [17]: Move to (2, -1, -1) - Red's Brick 5 hex with probability 4

Since we're pursuing the ore-wheat strategy, I want to limit Red's ability to build while securing key resources. The sheep 8 hex (1, -1, 0) is connected to both of Red's settlements, making it the most damaging placement to block. This would cut off their highest probability resource that produces at both settlements.

Also, with Red having 2 cards in hand, targeting a hex that produces their most likely resource (sheep) gives me the best chance of stealing something useful or at least disrupting their build plans.

<plan>
1. Move robber to Red's sheep 8 hex (1, -1, 0) to block their most productive resource
2. Continue focusing on gathering resources for city upgrades at node 13
3. Build road toward wheat port (nodes 25-26) when resources allow
4. Save future development cards for largest army or victory points
</plan>

Based on this analysis, the most optimal move is to place the robber on Red's sheep 8 hex, which will block production from both of their settlements:

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 16 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Move robber to Red's sheep 8 hex (1, -1, 0) to block their most productive resource
2. Continue focusing on gathering resources for city upgrades at node 13
3. Build road toward wheat port (nodes 25-26) when resources allow
4. Save future development cards for largest army or victory points
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.
  To adjust your plan, provide a NEW PLAN in your reasoning with <plan>your new plan</plan>

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze my current game state and options:

## Current Resources
- 1 sheep
- 1 wheat
- 1 ore

## Victory Point Status
- Me (Blue): 2/10 VP
- Red: 2/10 VP (tied)

## Available Actions
1. Buy a development card (costs 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore)
2. End turn

## Strategic Considerations

**Current Plan Evaluation:**
- I'd planned to move the robber to Red's sheep hex (1, -1, 0), but I can't do that now as it's not my roll phase
- I'm focusing on city upgrades but lack sufficient resources at the moment
- I want to build toward the wheat port eventually

**Development Card Analysis:**
- Development cards could provide:
  - Victory point (instant hidden VP)
  - Knight (defense + working toward largest army)
  - Year of Plenty (get 2 resources of choice)
  - Monopoly (steal all of one resource type)
  - Road Building (2 free roads)
- I already have 1 knight played, so additional knights help toward largest army (2 VP)
- Any development card would use all my current resources

**Ending Turn:**
- If I end turn without using resources, I'll get new production next turn
- My settlements produce:
  - Node 13: wheat on 11, ore on 3 and 6
  - Node 39: wheat on 5, sheep on 3
- The robber is currently on the wheat 11 hex, blocking my best wheat production

**Decision Making:**
Since I'm following the ore-wheat strategy focusing on cities, development cards are a good secondary option when I can't immediately build a city. A development card could provide a VP directly, help achieve largest army, or give me useful special actions.

I have exactly the resources needed for a development card (1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore), and this aligns with my strategy of using development cards when I have excess sheep/wheat/ore.

<plan>
1. Buy development card with current resources
2. Continue saving resources for city upgrade at node 13 (needs 2 more ore and 2 more wheat)
3. Consider moving robber on next roll if I get a 7 or play a knight card
4. Build toward wheat port when resources allow
5. Keep aiming for city-focused strategy and largest army bonus
</plan>

Since I have exactly the resources needed for a development card and no ability to make progress toward a city this turn, purchasing a development card is the optimal choice.

❓ Select action by number (0-1):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the game state and determine the best action to take for the ore-wheat strategy.

Current game status:
- I have 2 VP (2 settlements + 1 hidden VP card)
- RED has 5 VP (1 settlement + 1 city + Longest Road)
- I have 1 sheep, 2 wheat, 1 ore
- I'm following a city-focused strategy

Available actions:
[0] End turn
[1] Buy a development card (costs 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore)

Let me evaluate these options:

Option 0 (End turn):
- I keep my resources (1 sheep, 2 wheat, 1 ore)
- I'm still far from upgrading a settlement to a city (need 3 ore and 2 wheat total)
- I make no progress this turn

Option 1 (Buy development card):
- Benefits:
  - Could get a Victory Point card (immediate hidden VP)
  - Could get Knight (helps toward Largest Army bonus)
  - Could get Year of Plenty or Monopoly (help gather resources for city)
- Risks:
  - Might delay city upgrade if I get a Knight instead of a resource-generating card
  - Uses up my valuable ore that I need for city upgrades

Strategic considerations:
1. RED is at 5 VP, making significant progress
2. I need to establish development card advantage to compete for Largest Army
3. I already have 1 Knight played while RED also has 1 Knight
4. My primary goal is to upgrade to cities for increased production
5. Development cards offer potential hidden VPs and strategic advantages

Looking at my current plan, it does suggest buying a development card as the next step. This aligns with the ore-wheat strategy's aim of acquiring VPs through both cities and development cards.

Given my low resource count, I don't have other build options available. A development card could provide me with immediate progress (VP or resource help), while waiting will just mean I hold onto resources with no immediate path to a city upgrade.

<plan>
1. Buy development card now
2. Continue saving resources for city upgrade at node 13 (needs 2 more ore and 2 more wheat)
3. Consider moving robber on next roll if I get a 7 or play a knight card
4. Build toward wheat port when resources allow
5. Keep aiming for city-focused strategy and largest army bonus
</plan>

Buying a development card gives me the best chance of making progress this turn, either through a hidden VP or through cards that will help me gather resources for my city upgrade.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze my current position and options:

**Victory Points:** 
- I have 2 visible VP (2 settlements) + 1 hidden VP (VP card) = 3 VP
- RED has 6 VP (2 cities = 4 VP + longest road = 2 VP)

**Resources:**
- I only have 1 wheat
- RED has 1 hidden card
- The robber is currently on a wheat hex (-1, 0, 1) that produces on 11

**Development Cards:**
- I have 1 Knight and 1 Victory Point card

**My settlements:**
- Node 13: produces ore (3 and 6) and wheat (11) - but wheat is blocked by robber
- Node 39: produces wheat (5) and sheep (3)

## Option Analysis

1. **Option 0: Play Knight card**
   - Would move the robber off the wheat hex that produces on 11
   - This would unblock my best wheat production
   - Could potentially steal a resource from RED
   - Would advance toward Largest Army (I'd have 2 knights played vs RED's 1)

2. **Option 1: Roll the dice**
   - Normal dice roll
   - If I roll a 6 or 3, I get ore
   - If I roll a 5, I get wheat
   - If I roll a 3, I get sheep
   - Other rolls would produce nothing for me

## Strategic Consideration

The robber is currently blocking my wheat production on node 13, which is my highest probability wheat hex (11). My current plan includes saving resources for a city upgrade which requires ore and wheat.

Playing the knight now would:
1. Unblock my wheat production
2. Possibly give me an extra resource by stealing from RED
3. Get me closer to Largest Army (2 VP)

Since I'm following the ore-wheat strategy and my wheat production is currently hampered, playing the knight is the optimal move to increase my resource generation potential.

<plan>
1. Play knight now to unblock my wheat production and steal a resource
2. Move the robber to RED's high-probability hex (either ore 11 or sheep 8)
3. Continue saving resources for city upgrade at node 13 (needs 3 ore and 2 wheat)
4. Build toward wheat port when resources allow
5. Focus on getting largest army (need one more knight)
</plan>

# Game Analysis: Robber Placement Decision

Let me analyze the current game state and robber placement options:

## Current Situation
- I (BLUE) have 2 VP + 1 hidden VP card = 3 VP total
- RED has 6 VP (4 from cities + 2 from longest road)
- I need to perform a knight action - moving the robber and stealing a resource
- Current robber is on tile (-1, 0, 1) which is a wheat 11 hex (good probability)
- I have only 1 wheat resource currently

## Key Strategic Points:
1. RED is leading with 6 VP vs my 3 VP
2. RED has cities at nodes 7 and 1, which produce valuable resources
3. I should target high-probability hexes that RED relies on

## Robber Target Analysis:
Looking at RED's cities:
- City at node 7: produces 🐑8 (high probability), 🌲6 (high probability), 🧱5 (medium)
- City at node 1: produces 🌾4 (low probability), 🐑8 (high probability), ⛏️11 (medium-high)

The best targets would be:
- Option [1]: Move robber to (1, -1, 0) = 🐑8 hex - blocks RED's BOTH cities (they get sheep from both cities)
- Option [5]: Move robber to (1, 0, -1) = ⛏️11 hex - blocks RED's city ore production
- Option [6]: Move robber to (2, -2, 0) = 🌲6 hex - blocks RED's wood production

Since RED already has 6 VP and cities are expensive, blocking ore is particularly valuable to slow down their progress. However, blocking the sheep 8 hex would affect BOTH of their cities, which makes it a more impactful move.

<plan>
1. Move robber to sheep 8 hex to block both of RED's cities
2. Continue saving resources for city upgrade at node 13 (needs 3 ore and 2 wheat)
3. Build toward wheat port when resources allow
4. Focus on getting largest army (need one more knight)
</plan>

Based on analysis, I should choose option [1] which moves the robber to the sheep 8 hex (1, -1, 0) and allows me to steal from RED. This blocks production from both RED's cities since they both produce from this hex.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 38 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Move robber to sheep 8 hex to block both of RED's cities
2. Continue saving resources for city upgrade at node 13 (needs 3 ore and 2 wheat)
3. Build toward wheat port when resources allow
4. Focus on getting largest army (need one more knight)

# Analyzing Game State

Let me carefully evaluate the current game state and the best action for our optimal ore-wheat strategy:

## Current Resources
- 2 wheat, 2 ore
- 1 hidden victory point card
- 2 knights played (need 1 more for largest army)

## Victory Point Count
- BLUE (us): 2 VP (settlements) + 1 VP (hidden card) = 3 VP
- RED: 6 VP (4 from cities + 2 from longest road)

## Key Game Factors
1. RED is ahead with 6 VP vs our 3 VP
2. Our resources are limited - just 2 wheat and 2 ore
3. We need 3 ore + 2 wheat for a city upgrade
4. The robber is already on sheep 8, blocking both of RED's cities
5. No available build options with current resources

## Strategic Analysis

I can't afford anything with my current resources:
- City upgrade costs 3 ore + 2 wheat (I have 2 ore + 2 wheat)
- Settlement costs 1 brick + 1 wood + 1 wheat + 1 sheep (missing brick, wood, sheep)
- Road costs 1 brick + 1 wood (missing both)
- Development card costs 1 ore + 1 wheat + 1 sheep (missing sheep)

For maritime trade, I have access to the 2:1 ore port at nodes 38,39 (our settlement is at 39). This means I could trade 2 ore for 1 of any resource, but this isn't optimal for our city-focused strategy.

Given that:
1. I don't have enough resources to build anything
2. The robber is already in an optimal position blocking both RED's cities on the sheep 8 hex
3. I have no immediate build opportunities that would advance my strategy

<plan>
1. Continue saving resources for city upgrade at node 13 (needs 1 more ore)
2. Build toward wheat port when resources allow
3. Focus on getting largest army (need one more knight)
4. Target expanding to a wheat or ore hex for my next settlement
</plan>

The optimal move is to end my turn and wait for better resource accumulation.

# Analyzing Game State and Robber Placement Options

Let me assess the current game situation to make the optimal robber placement:

## Game Status Overview
- I have 2 VP (2 settlements + 1 hidden VP card)
- RED has 6 VP (2 cities + longest road) and is ahead
- I have 3 wheat and 1 ore, need 2 more ore for my city upgrade at node 13
- I need to obstruct RED's production and hopefully steal an ore

## Examining Red's Production
RED's cities are at nodes 1 and 7, producing:
- Node 1: wheat (4), sheep (8), ore (11)
- Node 7: sheep (8), wood (6), brick (5)

## Key Hexes to Consider Blocking
1. (1, -1, 0) - Sheep 8: Blocks one of RED's strongest production hexes that feeds both cities
2. (1, 0, -1) - Ore 11: Blocks RED's ore production, which I also need
3. (0, 0, 0) - Wheat 4: Blocks RED's wheat production
4. (2, -2, 0) - Wood 6: Blocks RED's wood production
5. (2, -1, -1) - Brick 5: Blocks RED's brick production

## Best Options Analysis:
- Option [1]: Block sheep 8 hex (1, -1, 0) - This is a high-probability hex (5 pips) that feeds both of RED's cities
- Option [5]: Block ore 11 hex (1, 0, -1) - This blocks ore which is critical for city building (for both of us)

The sheep 8 hex provides the most value to RED since it feeds both cities and has a high probability. Blocking this will significantly hamper RED's production. Additionally, I might steal a valuable resource.

Since RED is at 6 VP and I need to slow them down while advancing my own strategy, I'll place the robber on the sheep 8 hex that affects both of RED's cities.

<plan>
1. Move robber to sheep 8 hex to disrupt RED's production and possibly steal ore
2. Continue saving for city upgrade at node 13 (need 2 more ore now)
3. Consider buying a development card if I get sheep to potentially gain largest army
4. Build toward ore or wheat hexes for future settlement spots
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game State Analysis

Let me carefully analyze the current state of the game and determine the optimal robber placement.

## Current Situation
- I have 2 VP (2 settlements + 1 hidden VP card)
- RED has 6 VP (2 cities + longest road)
- RED is much closer to winning, with powerful resource generation
- I need to save up for a city upgrade at node 13, requiring 2 more ore
- I need to disrupt RED's production while maximizing my chances of getting useful resources

## Robber Placement Analysis

I need to consider:
1. Which hex will hurt RED's production the most
2. Which placement gives me the highest chance of stealing ore or wheat
3. Protecting my own high-value hexes

Let's check RED's settlements/cities:
- RED has a city at node 7 (produces: 🐑8, 🌲6, 🧱5)
- RED has a city at node 1 (produces: 🌾4, 🐑8, ⛏️11)

The best targets are:
- Option [1]: Move to 🐑8 (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED
  * This blocks RED's strong sheep production (8 is high probability)
  * Both of RED's cities produce from this hex (double impact)
  
- Option [5]: Move to ⛏️11 (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED
  * This blocks RED's ore production
  * Ore is crucial for city upgrades, which RED might be planning

Looking at these two options:
- Option [1] impacts both of RED's cities, making it more disruptive
- Option [5] targets ore, which is more valuable for the city-building strategy

I think the sheep hex (8) is the most damaging choice since:
1. It impacts BOTH of RED's cities (double impact)
2. The 8 is a high-probability number
3. It gives me a chance to steal a valuable resource from RED

<plan>
1. Move robber to sheep 8 hex to disrupt BOTH of RED's cities
2. Continue saving for city upgrade at node 13 (need 2 more ore)
3. Consider development card if I get sheep
4. Build toward ore or wheat hexes for future settlement locations
</plan>

  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 46 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Move robber to sheep 8 hex to disrupt BOTH of RED's cities
2. Continue saving for city upgrade at node 13 (need 2 more ore)
3. Consider development card if I get sheep
4. Build toward ore or wheat hexes for future settlement locations

# Game Analysis and Decision

Let me analyze the current game state and my options to determine the best course of action.

## Current Game Situation
- I have 2 VP (2 settlements) + 1 hidden VP card = 3 VP total
- RED has 6 VP (2 cities + longest road) and is much closer to winning
- Resources: 1 brick, 2 wheat, 2 ore
- The robber is on sheep 8, which is good as it's disrupting RED's two cities

## Resources Needed for Next Builds
- To upgrade settlement at node 13 to a city: Need 3 ore + 2 wheat (I have 2 ore, 2 wheat already)
- Need 1 more ore to build a city

## Available Actions
- End turn [0]
- Trade options using my 2:1 ore port [1-4]

## Decision Analysis
1. I don't have enough ore to use my 2:1 ore port (would need at least 2 ore to trade)
2. Even with my current resources, I'm just 1 ore short of building a city at node 13
3. RED is at 6 VP and much closer to winning than I am
4. My settlement at node 13 produces ore (from two hexes!) which increases my chances of getting that last ore I need next round

Since I cannot build anything meaningful this turn and I don't have enough resources to make an effective port trade, the best option is to end my turn and hope for favorable dice rolls next round.

<plan>
1. End turn now, continue saving for city upgrade at node 13 (need 1 more ore)
2. Use my ore port if I get excess ore next turn
3. After upgrading to city at node 13, focus on building roads toward another ore/wheat hex for a third settlement
4. Continue playing knights to work toward largest army (already have 2 played)
</plan>

I'll end my turn and hope to get the ore I need from dice rolls next round.

\boxed{0}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location

- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and the best robber placement choice:

## Current Situation:
- BLUE (me): 2 VP (visible) + 1 hidden VP = 3 VP, 2 settlements, needing 1 more ore for city upgrade
- RED: 6 VP with 2 cities and longest road, clearly in the lead
- I need to slow RED down and protect/advance my ore-wheat strategy

## Robber Placement Priorities:
1. Maximize damage to RED player (in the lead)
2. Target high-value hexes producing ore/wheat for RED
3. Protect my own ore/wheat production
4. Potentially steal a useful resource from RED

## Analyzing RED's Production:
- RED has cities at nodes 1 and 7
- City at node 1 produces: Wheat4, Sheep8, Ore11
- City at node 7 produces: Sheep8, Wood6, Brick5

## Best Robber Placements:

Let me evaluate the top options:
- Option [5]: Move to (1, 0, -1) = Ore11 hex, which RED produces from node 1
  - This blocks a key ore hex for RED's city
  - RED has a city here, so production is doubled
  - I can steal from RED
  - This directly impacts RED's ore production, crucial for city-building

- Option [6]: Move to (2, -2, 0) = Wood6 hex, which RED produces from node 7
  - This blocks wood, which isn't critical to my ore-wheat strategy
  - RED has a city here, so production is doubled

- Option [0]: Move to (0, 0, 0) = Wheat4 hex, which RED produces from node 1
  - This blocks wheat, which is critical for city-building
  - But it's only a "4" probability, not as impactful as other options

Looking at the production numbers, placing the robber on the Ore11 hex (option 5) is optimal because:
1. It blocks RED's ore production, which directly hinders city-building
2. It's a high-probability number (11)
3. I can steal from RED, potentially getting a resource I need
4. It perfectly aligns with the ore-wheat strategy by limiting opponent's access to ore

<plan>
1. Move robber to Ore11 hex to block RED's ore production
2. Continue saving for city upgrade at node 13 (need 1 more ore)
3. After upgrading to city at node 13, focus on building roads toward another ore/wheat hex
4. Continue playing knights to work toward largest army
5. Target sheep production to gain development cards
</plan>

Given the analysis, the most strategic action is:

3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 48 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Move robber to Ore11 hex to block RED's ore production
2. Continue saving for city upgrade at node 13 (need 1 more ore)
3. After upgrading to city at node 13, focus on building roads toward another ore/wheat hex
4. Continue playing knights to work toward largest army
5. Target sheep production to gain development cards
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis: Settlers of Catan

I'll analyze the current game state and determine the optimal next move as part of my ore-wheat strategy.

## Current Game Status
- I have 2 VP (2 settlements + 1 hidden victory point card)
- RED has 6 VP (2 cities + longest road bonus)
- RED is ahead by 4 VP and is much closer to winning
- I have 1 brick, 2 wheat, 3 ore
- The robber is on RED's ore hex (1, 0, -1)

## Resource Analysis
- I have almost enough resources for a city upgrade (need 2 wheat, 3 ore - I have 2 wheat, 3 ore)
- My settlements are on nodes 13 and 39
- Node 13 produces ore (two hexes: 3 and 6) and wheat (11) - this is my main production center
- Node 39 produces wheat (5) and sheep (3)

## Decision Logic

Looking at my available actions:
1. I can upgrade to a city at node 13 (costs 2 wheat, 3 ore)
2. I can upgrade to a city at node 39 (costs 2 wheat, 3 ore)
3-6. I can trade at ports, but these are inefficient uses of my current resources

The choice is between upgrading node 13 or node 39:

**Node 13:**
- Produces from ore-6, ore-3, and wheat-11
- Upgrading would double production from three strong hexes
- This node has two ore sources, making it perfect for the ore-wheat strategy
- Will significantly increase my ore production (essential for more cities)

**Node 39:**
- Produces from wheat-5 and sheep-3
- Less valuable production overall
- Has access to a 2:1 ore port which is nice, but production is more important

Clearly, upgrading node 13 is the better choice. It doubles my production on my best resource-generating settlement which produces both ore and wheat - the key resources for my strategy.

<plan>
1. Upgrade settlement to city at node 13 to double ore and wheat production
2. Focus on buying development cards with excess sheep to work toward largest army
3. Plan next expansion toward another strong ore or wheat hex
4. Continue playing knights to protect our high-value hexes
5. Aim for 3 cities + 2 settlements + largest army to reach 10 VP
</plan>

The optimal move is to upgrade my settlement at node 13 to a city:

\boxed{1}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)

# Game Analysis for Turn 52

Let me analyze the current state of the game and determine the best action.

## Current Game Status
- I (BLUE) have 3 VP (1 city, 1 settlement, 1 hidden Victory Point card)
- RED has 6 VP (2 cities, longest road)
- I have 1 BRICK and 2 ORE in hand
- I'm at a 2:1 ORE port (at node 39, which is my settlement)

## Resource Analysis
To execute our ore-wheat strategy effectively, I need to make progress toward:
1. City upgrades (requires 3 ORE + 2 WHEAT)
2. Development cards (requires 1 ORE + 1 WHEAT + 1 SHEEP)

My current resources (1 BRICK, 2 ORE) are not enough for either of these key builds.

## Available Actions
The only actions available on this turn are:
- End turn [0]
- Maritime trade options [1-4] using my ORE port (2:1)

## Action Evaluation
Since I have 2 ORE, I can use my 2:1 ORE port to trade for a resource I need. Given my current "ore-wheat strategy", I need to assess which resource would be most valuable:

- BRICK [1]: I already have 1 BRICK. Another BRICK could allow for road building, but this doesn't align with my strategy of focusing on city upgrades and development cards.
- WHEAT [2]: This would give me 1 WHEAT, which is a core resource for both cities and development cards.
- SHEEP [3]: This would give me 1 SHEEP, which I need for development cards.
- WOOD [4]: This would give me 1 WOOD, which is only useful for roads and settlements.

Since I'm following the ore-wheat strategy and my resources are limited, I need to make the most effective trade. WHEAT is a core resource that I'll need for both city upgrades and development cards, making it the most versatile choice.

<plan>
1. Trade 2 ORE for 1 WHEAT to begin accumulating resources for my next city upgrade
2. Next turn, focus on acquiring more ORE and WHEAT to continue with the city upgrade plan
3. Keep monitoring for development card opportunities to work toward largest army
4. Consider future expansion opportunities once I have sufficient resources
5. Continue protecting my high-value hexes from the robber
</plan>

Since WHEAT is a fundamental resource for my strategy and will be useful no matter what my next build is, I'll trade my 2 ORE for 1 WHEAT.

\boxed{2}

- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 58 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Trade 2 ORE for 1 WHEAT to begin accumulating resources for my next city upgrade
2. Next turn, focus on acquiring more ORE and WHEAT to continue with the city upgrade plan
3. Keep monitoring for development card opportunities to work toward largest army
4. Consider future expansion opportunities once I have sufficient resources
5. Continue protecting my high-value hexes from the robber

# Game Analysis and Decision Making

Let me analyze the current game state and determine the best action for my ore-wheat strategy.

## Current Game State
- I have 3 VP (2 from buildings + 1 hidden VP card)
- Red has 8 VP (6 from buildings + 2 from longest road)
- Red is very close to winning (needs only 2 more VP)
- I have 1 brick, 1 sheep, 2 wheat, 2 ore resources
- I have a city at node 13 producing ore and wheat on good numbers (6, 11)
- I have access to a 2:1 ore port at node 39

## Options Analysis

1. **End Turn (Action 0)**: This wastes my turn and builds nothing. Not optimal.

2. **Buy Development Card (Action 1)**: 
   - Costs 1 sheep + 1 wheat + 1 ore
   - I have these resources available
   - Potential benefits: Could get VP card, knight (for largest army), or helpful action card
   - Development cards are key in the ore-wheat strategy
   - Red only has 1 knight played, so largest army (2VP) is still obtainable
   - With Red at 8VP, I need every VP I can get

3. **Maritime Trade (Actions 2-5)**:
   - I have the ore port, but trading ore is counter to my core strategy
   - Trading for wheat isn't necessary as I already have 2 wheat
   - Trading for other resources doesn't align with my primary city-focused strategy

## Strategic Considerations
- Red is dangerously close to winning with 8VP
- I need to accelerate my VP accumulation
- Development cards offer the fastest path to victory points (direct VP cards or largest army)
- I already have 2 knights played - one more would give me largest army (2VP)
- With ore-wheat strategy, development cards are a key component

<plan>
1. Buy development cards to work toward largest army (need 1 more knight)
2. Look for opportunities to accumulate ore and wheat for city upgrades
3. Use my ore port strategically only when I have excess ore
4. Protect my high-value hexes from the robber
5. Consider expanding to secure another wheat production spot if possible
</plan>

Given Red's strong position at 8VP, my best option is to buy a development card which could:
- Give me a direct VP card
- Give me a knight to secure largest army (2VP)
- Provide a helpful action card (Year of Plenty, Monopoly, Road Building)

Therefore, I choose:

\boxed{1}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

# Game Analysis

I'll evaluate the current game state and decide on the best course of action between playing the Road Building card or rolling the dice.

## Game State Assessment
- I have 3 VP (1 settlement, 1 city, 1 hidden VP card)
- My opponent has 8 VP (2 settlements, 2 cities, longest road)
- My resources: 1 brick, 1 wheat, 1 ore
- I have a Road Building card and a Victory Point card
- I've played 2 knights (need 1 more for largest army)
- I have access to a 2:1 ore port

## Critical Considerations
1. My opponent is at 8 VP and close to winning
2. I need 7 more VP to win
3. I have no immediate build opportunities with my current resources
4. The robber is currently on an ore hex (1,0,-1), which blocks an opponent's city

## Option Analysis

**Option 0: Play Road Building**
- Advantages:
  - Could set up future settlement locations
  - Uses a development card I've been holding
- Disadvantages:
  - No immediate VP gain
  - No obvious high-value settlement locations identified
  - My primary strategy is ore-wheat for cities, not road expansion
  - No immediate build opportunity even after placing roads

**Option 1: Roll the Dice**
- Advantages:
  - May get additional resources for development card (aiming for knight)
  - Could get resources for city upgrade (my primary strategy)
  - Preserves Road Building card for strategic expansion when needed
- Disadvantages:
  - Unpredictable outcome

## Strategic Direction
My opponent is very close to winning (8/10 VP), while I'm far behind (3/10 VP). I need to immediately focus on:
1. Getting another knight to secure largest army (2 VP)
2. Upgrading my settlement to a city (1 VP)
3. Building another settlement (1 VP)
4. Finding ways to disrupt my opponent's progress

<plan>
1. Roll for resources to purchase development cards (hoping for knights)
2. Work toward largest army (need 1 more knight)
3. Save resources for upgrading my settlement at node 39 to a city
4. Use Road Building strategically when I have a clear expansion path
5. Move the robber to disrupt opponent's strongest production if possible
</plan>

The Road Building card doesn't provide immediate progress toward my victory conditions, whereas rolling gives me a chance to collect resources that can help me purchase development cards or save toward city upgrades.

I should roll the dice and keep my Road Building card for when I have a clearer expansion strategy.

- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 60 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Roll for resources to purchase development cards (hoping for knights)
2. Work toward largest army (need 1 more knight)
3. Save resources for upgrading my settlement at node 39 to a city
4. Use Road Building strategically when I have a clear expansion path
5. Move the robber to disrupt opponent's strongest production if possible

# Game Analysis

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 3 VP: 1 city (2 VP), 1 settlement (1 VP) and 1 hidden VP card
- My opponent has 8 VP and is close to winning with just 2 more points needed
- Resources: 1 brick, 1 wheat, 1 ore - not enough for immediate city upgrade
- I have a Road Building dev card available to play

## Options Analysis

**Option 0: Play Road Building**
- This would allow me to build two roads for free
- Benefits:
  - Can extend my potential for future settlements
  - Makes progress without spending resources
  - Could potentially work toward longest road (though challenging given RED has 6-road lead)
- Destinations to consider:
  - From node 39 toward ore port nodes (already connected)
  - From node 13 toward potential new settlement locations
  - Could build toward node 33 and 32 for the general port

**Option 1: End Turn**
- Benefits:
  - Save my Road Building card for when I have a clearer expansion strategy
  - Next turn I might get resources needed for city upgrade

## Strategic Evaluation

Looking at the big picture:
- RED player is at 8 VP and close to winning
- I need to accelerate my VP acquisition
- My Road Building card could help me reach new settlement locations

Since I can't currently upgrade my settlement at node 39 to a city (would need 3 ore + 2 wheat), and I can't build a new settlement (would need 1 more brick + 1 wood + 1 sheep), playing Road Building makes strategic sense to set up future expansion.

<plan>
1. Use Road Building card to construct roads from node 13 toward potential new settlement spots
2. Target expanding toward resources I lack (especially wood and sheep)
3. Continue accumulating resources for upgrading settlement at node 39 to a city
4. Watch for opportunities to disrupt RED's progress with robber placement on next rolls
5. Work toward another knight to secure largest army (2 VP) if possible
</plan>

Since I can make progress with the Road Building card and have no other immediate builds available, I'll play the card.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:

2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and determine the best strategic move:

## Current Victory Points
- BLUE (me): 3 VP (1 city, 1 settlement, 1 hidden VP card)
- RED: 8 VP (2 cities, 2 settlements, Longest Road bonus)

RED is dangerously close to winning with 8/10 VP.

## Resources
I currently have: 1 🧱BRICK, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE - limited resources for immediate builds.

## Development Cards
- I have 1 VICTORY_POINT card (already counted in my VP total)
- I've played 2 KNIGHT cards, 1 MONOPOLY card, and 1 ROAD_BUILDING card

## Strategic Assessment

The most pressing issue is that RED is at 8 VP and could potentially win soon. I need to focus on:

1. Increasing my own VP count (currently at 3/10)
2. Positioning for better resource production
3. Preparing for city upgrades

Looking at my road building options, I need to consider:
- Expansion possibilities
- Access to critical resources I'm lacking (especially wood)
- Potential to block RED's expansion

## Road Placement Analysis

Let me evaluate each road option:

- [0] Edge (13, 14): Extends toward the wheat port and the wood port direction
- [1] Edge (38, 39): Connects to my settlement at node 39, but doesn't open new expansion opportunities
- [2] Edge (15, 17): Connects between nodes that don't have my settlements
- [3] Edge (12, 13): Connects to my city at node 13, opens path toward wheat/sheep hexes
- [4] Edge (34, 35): Extends toward the wood port from my city at node 13
- [5] Edge (33, 34): Doesn't seem strategically valuable
- [6] Edge (17, 18): Extends from my settlement's road toward sheep hex
- [7] Edge (39, 41): Extends from my settlement toward sheep hex

Given my current ore-wheat strategy, I need to focus on:
1. Access to more ore/wheat production
2. Setting up for future city upgrades
3. Gaining access to wood which I currently lack

Option [4] (edge 34, 35) offers the best strategic value as it:
- Extends toward the wood port (2:1) which will help address my wood shortage
- Creates a path for potential expansion from my strongest production point (city at node 13)
- Helps me establish presence in an area with minimal RED presence

<plan>
1. Build road toward wood port to help address wood shortage
2. Continue accumulating resources for upgrading settlement at node 39 to a city
3. Look for opportunities to expand toward wood/sheep production
4. Try to acquire another knight to secure largest army (2 VP)
5. Use robber strategically to hinder RED's progress
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I choose option [4]:

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 60 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build road toward wood port to help address wood shortage
2. Continue accumulating resources for upgrading settlement at node 39 to a city
3. Look for opportunities to expand toward wood/sheep production
4. Try to acquire another knight to secure largest army (2 VP)
5. Use robber strategically to hinder RED's progress
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis for Turn 60

Let me analyze the current game state to make the optimal decision.

## Current Situation Assessment:
- I have 3 VP (1 city, 1 settlement, 1 VP card)
- RED has 8 VP (2 cities, 2 settlements, longest road)
- RED is very close to winning (just needs 2 more VP)
- My resources: 1 BRICK, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE
- I've played 2 Knights already (need one more for largest army)

## Resource Production Analysis:
- My city at node 13 produces ORE and WHEAT (excellent for ore-wheat strategy)
- My settlement at node 39 produces WHEAT and SHEEP
- I'm weak on WOOD production, which limits my ability to build
- The robber is on an ORE hex (1,0,-1), but not one I'm connected to

## Available Actions:
I only have 1 BRICK, so my only option is to build a road. I need to determine the best location.

## Road Placement Strategic Analysis:

1. Road at edge (35, 36) [Option 2]:
   - Leads to the 2:1 WOOD port
   - This would help address my wood shortage
   - Aligns with my current plan

2. Road at edge (38, 39) [Option 1]:
   - Connects toward the ORE port (which I already have access to)
   - Not particularly useful

3. Road at edge (13, 14) [Option 0]:
   - Expands from my city toward wheat production
   - Could create settlement opportunities

4. Other options lead to less strategic positions

Looking at the game state, I'm 5 VP behind RED who only needs 2 more VP to win. I need to accelerate my strategy.

Considering my plan to address the wood shortage and the limited resources I have, building the road toward the wood port makes the most sense. This will allow me to trade ore (which I produce well) for wood at a better rate.

<plan>
1. Build road toward wood port to address wood shortage
2. Focus on getting another knight to secure largest army (2 VP)
3. Upgrade settlement at node 39 to a city (needs 3 ore, 2 wheat)
4. Use the wood port to help facilitate further expansion
5. Target RED's key producing hexes with the robber when possible
</plan>

Given these considerations, I'll choose option 2: Build a road at edge (35, 36) toward the wood port.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!

- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)

# Game Analysis: Move Robber Decision

Let me analyze the current game state carefully to make the optimal robber placement decision.

## Game Status Overview
- RED has 8/10 victory points and is close to winning
- I have only 3/10 victory points (plus 1 hidden VP card)
- RED has 2 cities, 2 settlements, and longest road (+2 VP)
- I have 1 city, 1 settlement, and 2 knights played (need 1 more for largest army)

## Robber Placement Strategy
The robber placement should accomplish two key objectives:
1. Disrupt RED's highest-producing hexes to slow their progress
2. Steal a potentially useful resource (ideally ore or wheat)

## Target Analysis
Looking at RED's building production:
- City at node 7: 🐑8 (⭐⭐⭐), 🌲6 (⭐⭐⭐), 🧱5 (⭐⭐)
- City at node 1: 🌾4 (⭐), 🐑8 (⭐⭐⭐), ⛏️11 (⭐)
- Settlement at node 5: 🌾4 (⭐), 🌲4 (⭐), 🌾9 (⭐⭐)
- Settlement at node 27: 🌲6 (⭐⭐⭐), 🧱9 (⭐⭐)

The most productive hexes for RED are:
- 🐑8 (⭐⭐⭐) at (1, -1, 0) - connected to RED's city
- 🌲6 (⭐⭐⭐) at (2, -2, 0) - connected to RED's city and settlement
- ⛏️11 (⭐) at (1, 0, -1) - connected to RED's city

## Best Robber Placements
Action 1: Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED
- Blocks a high-probability sheep hex (8)
- This hex produces for RED's city at node 7
- Sheep could help RED buy development cards (possibly victory points)

Action 6: Move robber to (2, -2, 0) and steal from RED
- Blocks a high-probability wood hex (6)
- This hex produces for both RED's city and settlement
- Wood is critical for RED to continue building roads for longest road

Action 5: Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED
- Blocks an ore hex (11)
- This hex produces for RED's city at node 1
- Ore is critical for city upgrades

<plan>
1. Target RED's key producing hexes with the robber
2. Save up for another knight to secure largest army (2 VP)
3. Upgrade settlement at node 39 to a city (needs 3 ore, 2 wheat)
4. Consider building a road toward the wood port to address wood shortage
5. Prevent RED from getting to 10 points while building toward my victory
</plan>

Since RED is at 8 points and close to winning, I need to be extremely aggressive in disrupting their production. Looking at RED's buildings, the 🐑8 hex at (1, -1, 0) is a high-probability hex that produces for RED's city. Additionally, RED might be collecting sheep to buy development cards, possibly including victory point cards.

Therefore, my decision is to:

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

I need to analyze the current game state carefully and make the optimal decision.

## Current Game Situation
- **Victory Points**: I have 3 VP (1 city, 1 settlement, 1 hidden VP card)
- **RED has 8 VP** (2 cities, 2 settlements, longest road bonus)
- **My Resources**: 1 brick, 2 ore
- **I need 7 more VP to win**
- **Robber** is currently on a sheep hex (1, -1, 0)

## Strategic Assessment
RED is dangerously close to winning with 8 VP. They need just 2 more points, which could come from:
- Building 2 more settlements
- Building 1 more city
- Getting largest army (they already have 1 knight played)
- Getting VP development cards

I need to accelerate my own progress while hindering RED.

## Available Actions
I can:
- [0] End my turn
- [1-4] Do maritime trades at 2:1 rate (with my ore port)

Given my current resources (1 brick, 2 ore), I cannot:
- Build a settlement (need brick, wood, wheat, sheep)
- Build a city (need 3 ore, 2 wheat)
- Buy a development card (need ore, wheat, sheep)
- Build a road (need brick and wood)

## Decision Making
Since I don't have enough resources for any significant build, and RED is very close to winning, I need to consider my options:

1. **End Turn Option**: This means giving RED another turn while I'm still far behind.
2. **Maritime Trading**: I could trade some resources, but with only 1 brick and 2 ore, trading doesn't give me enough to build anything meaningful this turn.

Looking at the board state, I have minimal resources and no immediate build options. I'll end my turn and hope for better rolls on the next round. I need to accumulate resources to upgrade my settlement at node 39 to a city as planned.

<plan>
1. Continue targeting RED's key producing hexes with the robber on future rolls of 7
2. Focus on accumulating ore and wheat to upgrade settlement at node 39 (needs 3 ore, 2 wheat)
3. Try to secure largest army by buying development cards when possible
4. Consider building a road toward the wood port when resources allow
5. Prevent RED from getting to 10 points while building toward my victory
</plan>

Given my limited options this turn, I will:

Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the game state and determine the optimal action based on my ore-wheat strategy.

## Game Analysis

### Current Game State
- BLUE (me): 3 VP (1 city, 1 settlement, 1 hidden VP card)
- RED: 8 VP (2 cities, 2 settlements, longest road)
- RED is only 2 VP away from winning
- I have 4 ore, 2 wheat, 1 brick

### Available Actions
- [0] End turn
- [1] Upgrade settlement at node 39 to city (costs 2 wheat, 3 ore)
- [2-5] Maritime trades using the ore port

### Critical Decision Factors
1. RED is at 8 VP and close to winning
2. I need to accelerate my VP acquisition
3. I have sufficient resources to upgrade my settlement to a city

## Action Analysis

**Option 1: Upgrade Settlement to City**
- This gives me +1 VP immediately (3→4 VP)
- Improves production at node 39 (wheat 5 and sheep 3) - doubles the resource gain
- Uses most of my current resources efficiently
- Aligns perfectly with the ore-wheat city-focused strategy
- Helps me catch up to RED

**Option 0: End Turn**
- Keeps resources for future turns
- Risky as RED might win on their next turn
- Doesn't advance my position in the game

**Options 2-5: Maritime Trading**
- Not necessary as I have the resources I need for the city upgrade
- Would be a waste of my valuable ore and wheat resources

## Strategic Decision

The clear optimal play is to upgrade my settlement at node 39 to a city. This:
1. Increases my victory points
2. Doubles production at that node
3. Follows the ore-wheat city-focused strategy
4. Makes efficient use of my current resources
5. Follows the primary winning path outlined in my strategy

<plan>
1. Upgrade settlement at node 39 to city this turn
2. Continue blocking RED's key resources with the robber when possible
3. Work toward largest army by buying development cards with excess resources
4. Build toward wood/brick producing areas to enable further expansion
5. Focus on getting to 3 cities total for 6 VP, plus 2 VP from largest army, plus my 1 VP card, plus another settlement
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze the current game state carefully to determine my optimal move as Blue.

## Current Game Status
- **Blue (me)**: 4 VP (2 cities, 1 hidden VP card)
- **Red (opponent)**: 8 VP (2 cities, 2 settlements, Longest Road bonus)
- Red is very close to winning, needing only 2 more VP

## My Resources
- 1 🧱 Brick
- 2 🐑 Sheep
- 3 ⛏️ Ore

## Available Actions
0. End turn
1-4. Maritime trade options using my 2:1 ore port

## Strategic Analysis

Red is at 8 VP and could potentially win soon. I'm at 4 VP (plus 1 hidden VP from a development card), so I need to make significant progress.

Given my current resources, let me evaluate what I can build or buy:
- Development Card: Costs 1 ore + 1 wheat + 1 sheep → I lack wheat
- Road: Costs 1 brick + 1 wood → I lack wood
- Settlement: Costs 1 brick + 1 wood + 1 wheat + 1 sheep → I lack wood and wheat
- City: Costs 3 ore + 2 wheat → I have enough ore but lack wheat

I have 3 ore, which could be valuable for a city upgrade if I can get wheat. I also have access to the 2:1 ore port, which means I could trade 2 ore for 1 of any other resource.

Looking at my options:
1. Trade 2 ore for 1 brick - Not helpful as I already have brick
2. Trade 2 ore for 1 wheat - This could help toward a development card
3. Trade 2 ore for 1 sheep - Not needed as I already have sheep
4. Trade 2 ore for 1 wood - Could help with road building

Since I'm following the ore-wheat strategy, development cards are valuable now:
- They can give me VP cards
- Knights can help me get Largest Army (+2 VP)
- Monopoly/Year of Plenty can accelerate my resource gathering

Given that Red is at 8 VP, I need to make progress toward my goal of cities and largest army. Trading for wheat seems most aligned with my strategy.

<plan>
1. Trade for wheat using my ore port this turn
2. Try to buy a development card if I get wheat next turn
3. Continue working toward largest army (I already have 2 knights)
4. Focus on getting another city or settlement when resources allow
5. Keep targeting Red's key resources with the robber
</plan>

Based on this analysis, my best move is to trade 2 ore for 1 wheat:

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze the current game state and make the optimal decision based on the ore-wheat city strategy.

## Current Situation Assessment
- I have 4 VP (2 cities + 1 hidden VP card)
- Red has 8 VP (2 cities + 2 settlements + longest road)
- Red is close to winning (just needs 2 more VP)
- I have 1 brick, 2 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore
- I have 2 knights played already
- I have access to a 2:1 ore port

## Options Analysis

**Option 0: End Turn**
- This would waste my turn with no progress
- Red is close to winning so I need to be aggressive

**Option 1: Buy Development Card**
- Cost: 1 sheep + 1 wheat + 1 ore
- I have exactly these resources
- Potential outcomes:
  - Knight: Would give me largest army (2 VP) as I already have 2 knights played
  - VP Card: Direct progress toward 10 VP
  - Year of Plenty/Monopoly: Would help resource acquisition
  - All outcomes are positive given my situation

## Strategic Considerations

Red is at 8 VP and getting close to winning. I need to make progress toward victory quickly. Buying a development card has high upside:
- If I get a knight, I can gain largest army (2 VP) to get to 6 VP total
- If I get a VP card, I'd reach 5 VP
- Either utility card would help my resource situation

I should follow the ore-wheat strategy by investing my current resources into a development card, which can potentially give me largest army or other benefits.

<plan>
1. Buy development card this turn
2. If I get a knight, play it to get largest army (2 VP)
3. Continue focusing on city upgrades when I get more ore/wheat
4. Move the robber to block Red's resource production on my next opportunity
5. Work toward 10 VP through cities, largest army, and VP cards
</plan>

The optimal decision is to:

\boxed{1}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 68 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Buy development card this turn
2. If I get a knight, play it to get largest army (2 VP)
3. Continue focusing on city upgrades when I get more ore/wheat
4. Move the robber to block Red's resource production on my next opportunity
5. Work toward 10 VP through cities, largest army, and VP cards
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

I need to analyze this critical decision: should I play my Knight card or roll the dice?

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 4 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + 1 hidden VP card
- RED has 9 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP)
- RED is ONE POINT away from winning
- I currently have 2 knights played; RED has 1 knight played
- Resources: 1 brick, 1 sheep, 2 wheat (limited resources)

## Knight Card Calculation
If I play my Knight card:
- I'd have 3 knights played vs RED's 1 knight
- This would give me Largest Army bonus (+2 VP)
- My VP would increase to 6 VP (getting closer to winning)
- I could move the robber to block RED's high-value production
- I could potentially steal a valuable resource from RED

## Roll Dice Calculation
If I roll the dice:
- I might get resources to build something
- But RED would get their turn next and likely win with 9 VP
- This is extremely risky given RED is at 9 VP

## Strategic Assessment
This is a clear emergency situation. RED is at 9 VP and will likely win on their next turn. My only chance is to disrupt their plans and accelerate my own victory.

<plan>
1. Play Knight NOW to get Largest Army (2 VP)
2. This brings me to 6 VP immediately
3. Move robber to RED's best hex (probably the Sheep 8 hex that produces for multiple settlements)
4. Try to steal ore or wheat from RED
5. On future turns, focus on getting resources for a settlement (need 2 more VP after Largest Army)
</plan>

The optimal play is clearly to use the Knight card to get Largest Army and disrupt RED's resource production. This is my only chance to prevent them from winning on their next turn.

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

I need to analyze the current game state and determine the best move for placing the robber. Let me think through this carefully.

## Game Status Assessment
- I (BLUE) have 6 VP (2 cities + largest army)
- RED has 9 VP and only needs 1 more to win
- RED has 5 hidden cards, which could potentially help them win next turn

## Strategic Priority
My main goal is to delay RED's victory while positioning myself for a comeback. With only 6 VP, I need 4 more to win. After playing the knight card, I need to maximize the impact of my robber placement.

## Robber Placement Analysis
The most effective robber placement will:
1. Block RED's highest value production
2. Target a hex that supplies multiple RED buildings
3. Allow me to steal a valuable resource (ideally ore or wheat)

Looking at RED's settlements and cities:
- RED has a city at node 7 producing sheep(8), wood(6), and brick(5)
- RED has a city at node 1 producing wheat(4), sheep(8), and ore(11)
- RED has settlements at nodes 5, 27, and 23

The sheep(8) hex at (1, -1, 0) is currently blocked by the robber already, so I should choose another high-value hex.

The ore(11) at (1, 0, -1) is a strong candidate as it:
- Produces for RED's city at node 1
- Also produces for RED's settlement at node 23
- Has a value of 11 (high probability)

The wood(6) at (2, -2, 0) is also valuable as it:
- Produces for RED's city at node 7
- Also produces for RED's settlement at node 27
- Has a value of 6 (very high probability)

## Final Decision
Action [5] allows me to move the robber to the ore(11) hex at (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED.
Action [6] allows me to move the robber to the wood(6) hex at (2, -2, 0) and steal from RED.

Since ore is more critical for city building (which RED might be planning), and it affects both a city and a settlement, I'll choose option [5].

<plan>
1. Move robber to RED's ore(11) hex to block their city building potential
2. Try to steal ore or wheat from RED
3. Next turn, work toward building a settlement (need wood and brick)
4. Continue blocking RED's best resources while building up to 10 VP
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 68 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Move robber to RED's ore(11) hex to block their city building potential
2. Try to steal ore or wheat from RED
3. Next turn, work toward building a settlement (need wood and brick)
4. Continue blocking RED's best resources while building up to 10 VP
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis

I need to carefully consider my options in this critical position where my opponent RED is at 9/10 victory points and I'm at 6/10.

## Current Game State Assessment
- RED has 9 VP (2 cities, 3 settlements, longest road bonus)
- I have 6 VP (2 cities, largest army, 1 VP card)
- My resources: 1 brick, 1 sheep, 2 wheat, 1 ore
- RED has 9 hidden cards - potentially enough to win next turn

## Available Actions Analysis
I only have two options:
1. Buy a development card (1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore)
2. End my turn

## Strategic Considerations

RED is one point away from victory, so my priority must be to prevent them from winning on their next turn while advancing my own position.

### Option 1: Buy a Development Card
- Cost: 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore
- Potential outcomes:
  * Knight (most common) - Would strengthen my largest army bonus
  * Victory Point - Would put me at 7/10 VP
  * Road Building - Less useful currently
  * Year of Plenty - Could help get resources for my next build
  * Monopoly - Could disrupt RED's plans

### Option 0: End Turn
- I'd keep my current resources (1 brick, 1 sheep, 2 wheat, 1 ore)
- This isn't enough for a settlement (need 1 more brick and 1 more wood)
- RED would get their turn and potentially win

<plan>
1. Buy a development card to potentially increase my VP or get a knight
2. If it's a knight, use it next turn to move the robber to RED's wheat hexes
3. Continue focusing on getting resources for a settlement (need brick and wood)
4. Work toward reaching 10 VP through one more settlement (7VP) plus 3 more VP cards
</plan>

The development card is clearly the superior option because:
1. It removes resources from my hand (safer if I roll a 7)
2. It gives me a chance at an immediate VP card
3. It might provide tactical advantages (knight, year of plenty, monopoly)
4. If I don't use resources now, RED might win before I get another chance

Given RED is at 9 VP, buying a development card represents my best chance to both improve my position and potentially disrupt RED's plans.

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me carefully analyze the current game state to make the optimal decision:

## Current Situation Assessment
- I have 6 VP (2 cities + Largest Army bonus)
- RED has 9 VP (2 cities + 3 settlements + Longest Road bonus) - just 1 VP away from winning!
- I have 1 Knight card and 1 Victory Point card in hand
- RED might have hidden VP cards or resources to build another settlement to win

## Resource Analysis
- I have 1 brick, 2 sheep, 1 wheat, 2 ore
- With these resources, I can't build any settlements or cities
- The robber is currently on RED's ore hex (1,0,-1), but it's not their most productive hex

## Strategic Options
1. **Play Knight**: This would let me move the robber to a more critical resource hex for RED and steal a resource
2. **Roll Dice**: This would generate new resources but risks letting RED get their turn where they might win

## Decision Logic
RED is at 9 VP and could win on their next turn. My top priority must be disrupting their production and delaying their win condition. Playing the Knight card accomplishes several things:
- I can move the robber to RED's best production hex (either sheep 8 or wood 6)
- I can potentially steal a valuable resource from RED
- I can disrupt RED's next turn's production
- This is a defensive move that's necessary given how close RED is to winning

<plan>
1. Play Knight card to move robber to RED's sheep hex (coordinates 1,-1,0) since it produces for two of their buildings
2. If I get good resources on my next roll, aim to build a settlement to increase my VP
3. Continue focusing on development cards to potentially get more VP cards
4. Look for opportunities to break RED's longest road if possible
</plan>

Given that RED is one point away from victory, I must play defensively. The optimal choice is to:

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 70 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Play Knight card to move robber to RED's sheep hex (coordinates 1,-1,0) since it produces for two of their buildings
2. If I get good resources on my next roll, aim to build a settlement to increase my VP
3. Continue focusing on development cards to potentially get more VP cards

# Game Analysis for Catan

I need to evaluate the optimal move for the robber to maximize my chances of winning while hindering RED who is at 9 VP and close to winning.

## Current Game State
- RED has 9 VP (nearly winning)
- I (BLUE) have 6 VP
- I've just played a knight card and must move the robber
- RED has 3 settlements, 2 cities, and longest road
- I have 2 cities and largest army

## Red's Key Production
Looking at RED's buildings:
- Settlement at node 23 produces from ⛏️11, 🐑8, 🧱5
- City at node 7 produces from 🐑8, 🌲6, 🧱5
- City at node 1 produces from 🌾4, 🐑8, ⛏️11
- Settlement at node 5 produces from 🌾4, 🌲4, 🌾9
- Settlement at node 27 produces from 🌲6, 🧱9

The hex (1,-1,0) with 🐑8 is especially valuable to RED as it produces for:
- City at node 7 (triple production)
- City at node 1 (triple production)

This sheep hex serves multiple buildings including two cities, making it a high-value target.

## Robber Placement Strategy
Moving the robber to the sheep hex at (1,-1,0) would:
1. Block a key resource production for RED (sheep)
2. Disable production for two of RED's cities
3. Allow me to steal a resource from RED
4. Potentially slow RED's development toward 10 VP

<plan>
1. Move robber to RED's sheep hex (coordinates 1,-1,0) to block production for two of their cities
2. Continue focusing on development cards for potential VP cards
3. If I get good rolls, build a settlement to increase my VP count
4. Look for opportunities to break RED's longest road if possible
</plan>

Since RED is only one point away from winning, disrupting their resource production is critical. The sheep hex at (1,-1,0) is the most impactful target as it affects multiple RED buildings, including two cities.

# Game Analysis: Settler of Catan Turn 70

Let me analyze my position and the game state carefully to determine the optimal move for my ore-wheat strategy.

## Game State Summary
- **Victory Points**: I have 6/10 VP, RED has 9/10 VP
- **My Resources**: 1 wood, 1 brick, 2 sheep, 1 wheat, 2 ore
- **My Development Cards**: 1 Victory Point card (hidden from opponent)
- **My Buildings**: 2 cities, 0 settlements, 4 roads, Largest Army (2 VP)
- **Opponent Status**: RED has 9/10 VP (only needs 1 more to win!)
- **Robber**: Currently on RED's sheep hex (1,-1,0)

## Critical Situation Assessment
RED is at 9 VP, just ONE point away from winning. This is an emergency situation where I must prevent them from winning on their next turn while making progress toward my own victory. Their next build will likely win them the game.

## Available Options Analysis

1. **End Turn (Action 0)** - This accomplishes nothing and gives RED a chance to win. Avoid.

2. **Build Road Options (Actions 1-8)** - I could use my 1 wood + 1 brick to build a road. However:
   - This doesn't increase my VP
   - Doesn't block RED from winning
   - Doesn't significantly improve my position

3. **Build Settlement Options (Actions 9-10)**
   - Would require trading away ore or using port trades to get resources
   - Would gain 1 VP (crucial in this close game)
   - Settlement at node 35 connects to the wood port
   - Settlement at node 36 connects to both the wood port and a 3:1 port
   - Both would add +1 VP, but I lack resources

4. **Buy Development Card (Action 11)**
   - Cost: 1 sheep + 1 wheat + 1 ore (I have these resources)
   - Potential outcomes:
     - Victory Point card (immediate +1 VP, hidden until I can win)
     - Knight (protect resources, build toward Largest Army - but I already have it)
     - Road Building (save wood/brick for settlements)
     - Year of Plenty (get exact resources needed)
     - Monopoly (mass resource acquisition)

## Strategic Decision
With RED at 9 VP, they'll likely win on their next turn. My priority must be:
1. Try to reach 10 VP before them (not possible this turn)
2. Buy a development card hoping for a Victory Point

If I get a VP card, I'll have 7 VP total (2 cities + Largest Army + 2 VP cards). I would still need 3 more VP to win. If I get a knight, monopoly, road building, or year of plenty, I could potentially use these to help my next builds.

Since I can't win this turn no matter what, and RED is 1 VP from winning, buying a development card is my best option as it offers the chance of a VP card (17 cards remain in the deck).

<plan>
1. Buy a development card hoping for a Victory Point card
2. If I get a non-VP card, use it strategically on my next turn to boost my position
3. Plan toward building settlements at nodes 35 or 36 to get access to the wood port
4. Look for opportunities to break RED's longest road if possible
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I will buy a development card:

\boxed{11}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 70 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Buy a development card hoping for a Victory Point card
2. If I get a non-VP card, use it strategically on my next turn to boost my position
3. Plan toward building settlements at nodes 35 or 36 to get access to the wood port
4. Look for opportunities to break RED's longest road if possible
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

❓ Select action by number (0-8):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state thoroughly and determine the optimal action for the ore-wheat strategy.

## Game Assessment:
- I have 6 VP (2 cities for 4 VP + Largest Army for 2 VP + hidden 1 VP card)
- RED player has 9 VP (2 cities for 4 VP + 3 settlements for 3 VP + Longest Road for 2 VP)
- RED is only 1 point away from winning
- I'm 4 points away from winning, needing either:
  - 2 more settlements + 1 more VP card OR
  - Build 1 more city + 1 more settlement

## Resource Analysis:
- I currently have 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 sheep, 1 ore
- I can build a road, but not a settlement (need more resources)
- I don't have enough resources for a city (need 3 ore + 2 wheat)
- I don't have enough for a development card (need 1 ore, 1 wheat, 1 sheep)

## Strategic Options:
1. Build a road - This could help extend toward a potential settlement location, but won't immediately improve my position
2. End turn - Save resources for a more significant build next turn

## Critical Considerations:
- RED is 1 VP away from winning
- I need to maximize my chances of getting more resources and reaching 10 VP faster
- Building a road now won't meaningfully change my position
- Saving resources could allow for a better build next turn

## Decision:
Since I can't make any game-changing moves this turn and RED is on the verge of winning, I should end my turn and save my resources. Building a road would deplete my wood and brick without immediate benefit, while keeping these resources may enable a more strategic build next turn if I receive additional resources.

<plan>
1. Save resources this turn to enable better builds next turn
2. Focus on getting more ore/wheat to build cities
3. Look for opportunities to break RED's longest road if possible
4. Aim to build at nodes 35 or 36 to access the wood port
5. Continue buying development cards when possible for VP cards or knights

- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 72 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Save resources this turn to enable better builds next turn
2. Focus on getting more ore/wheat to build cities
3. Look for opportunities to break RED's longest road if possible
4. Aim to build at nodes 35 or 36 to access the wood port
5. Continue buying development cards when possible for VP cards or knights
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis for Turn 72

Let me carefully analyze the current state of the game and determine the optimal move as a grandmaster Catan player executing the ore-wheat strategy.

## Current Situation Assessment
- I have 6 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + Largest Army (2 VP) + 1 hidden VP card
- RED has 9 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + Longest Road (2 VP)
- RED is ONE point away from winning - very dangerous situation
- I have limited resources: 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 sheep, 1 ore
- I have a MONOPOLY development card available to play

## Available Actions
I can either roll the dice or play my Monopoly card to take all of one resource type from RED.

## Strategic Considerations

1. **RED's Position:** They have 9 VP and are only 1 VP away from winning. They have 4 hidden resource cards which could potentially allow them to build another settlement or buy a VP development card on their next turn. This is extremely concerning.

2. **My Resources:** I have 1 of each resource except wheat. I'm not close to building anything significant with my current hand.

3. **Monopoly Card Value:** This could be a game-changing card if I choose the right resource. I need to consider what RED likely has and what would most benefit me.

4. **RED's Production:** 
   - RED has strong wheat production (4, 9)
   - RED has strong sheep production (8, 8) 
   - RED has strong brick production (5, 9)
   - RED has some ore production (11)
   
5. **My Build Needs:**
   - Need more ore/wheat for city upgrades (my core strategy)
   - Need resources to prevent RED from winning

## Monopoly Analysis
If I play Monopoly, which resource should I target?

- **Wheat:** RED has good wheat production. Taking all wheat would both benefit me (for my ore-wheat strategy) and potentially disrupt RED's ability to build.
- **Ore:** Critical for my city strategy, but RED has limited ore production so might not have much.
- **Brick/Wood:** Could disrupt RED's road building, but doesn't directly help my city strategy.
- **Sheep:** RED has excellent sheep production, so they might have some, but sheep is less crucial for my strategy.

Given that the robber is currently on a sheep hex (1, -1, 0), RED might have accumulated wheat since that production isn't blocked. Since wheat is crucial for my city-focused strategy and RED has good wheat production, monopolizing wheat seems most strategic.

## Decision
I should play Monopoly targeting wheat. This will:
1. Potentially disrupt RED's ability to build on their next turn
2. Give me wheat which I need for my ore-wheat strategy
3. Possibly set me up for a future city upgrade if I get enough wheat

<plan>
1. Play Monopoly for wheat to disrupt RED and gain resources I need
2. Continue focusing on ore/wheat accumulation for city upgrades
3. Watch for opportunities to break RED's longest road if possible
4. Keep developing toward the wood port at nodes 35/36
5. Buy development cards when possible for VP cards or knights
</plan>

\boxed{3}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)

- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section

# Game Analysis and Strategic Decision-Making

## Current Game State Assessment
- BLUE has 6 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 1 hidden VP card = 7 VP total
- RED has 9 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP) = 9 VP
- RED is just 1 VP away from winning!
- BLUE needs 3 more VP to win (or 2 more with the hidden VP card)

## Resource Analysis
- Current resources: 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 sheep, 2 wheat, 1 ore
- Production is primarily ore and wheat focused (good for cities)
- RED has 7 hidden cards - concerning as they're just 1 VP away from winning

## Available Options
1. End turn (not productive)
2. Build road (uses wood + brick, but doesn't advance VP directly)
3. Build settlement at node 35/36 (costs wood, brick, wheat, sheep - gives 1 VP)
4. Buy development card (costs sheep, wheat, ore - potential VP or knight card)

## Strategic Considerations
1. RED is just 1 VP away from winning - this is URGENT
2. A development card could give immediate VP or a knight (improving largest army defense)
3. Building a settlement gives an immediate visible VP and production boost
4. Nodes 35/36 are on a 2:1 wood port, which would help with future road building

## Decision Logic
Since RED is so close to winning at 9 VP, we must maximize our chances of getting VP immediately. A settlement guarantees 1 VP, whereas a development card is risky (could be a knight, monopoly, road building, year of plenty, or VP).

However, if we build a settlement, we'll use our wood and brick, preventing RED from getting those resources if they need them for their final VP. We'd also have 1 wheat and 1 ore leftover, which isn't enough to do anything significant next turn.

Building at node 36 would give access to the wood port and put us in position to develop toward node 37, which touches the ore hex with value 6. This would strengthen our ore production significantly.

<plan>
1. Build settlement at node 36 giving immediate VP and securing the wood port
2. Use the wood port to convert future wood production into needed resources
3. Continue developing toward ore production at node 37
4. Buy development cards when excess resources are available
5. Watch for opportunities to break RED's longest road
</plan>

Since RED is at 9 VP, we need to make decisive progress now. Building a settlement guarantees 1 VP and provides future production value.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis & Decision

Let me evaluate the current situation thoroughly:

## Victory Points Assessment:
- BLUE (me): 7 VP (2 cities = 4 VP, 1 settlement = 1 VP, Largest Army = 2 VP, 1 hidden VP card = 1 VP)
- RED: 9 VP (2 cities = 4 VP, 3 settlements = 3 VP, Longest Road = 2 VP)

RED is at 9 VP, just 1 point away from winning. This is extremely dangerous - they could win on their next turn if they have resources for a settlement or city, or if they have a VP card.

## Resources:
- I have: 2 sheep, 3 wheat, 3 ore
- RED has 12 hidden resource cards

## Available Actions:
1. Upgrade settlement to city at node 36 (Cost: 2 wheat, 3 ore)
2. Buy a development card (1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore)
3-6. Various maritime trades

## Strategic Evaluation:

1. **Upgrading to a city** would:
   - Increase my VP to 8
   - Use all my ore and 2 wheat
   - Double production at node 36 (ore)
   - Leave me with 1 wheat and 2 sheep

2. **Buying a development card** would:
   - Possibly get me a VP card (bringing me to 8 VP immediately)
   - Possibly get a knight to strengthen my largest army bonus
   - Use 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore
   - Leave me with 1 sheep, 2 wheat, 2 ore

The city upgrade ensures 1 guaranteed VP, while the development card is a gamble. But given RED is at 9 VP, I need to both advance myself and possibly interfere with RED's position.

<plan>
1. Buy a development card to potentially get an immediate VP (which would put me at 8 VP)
2. If I get a knight or other action card, I can use it next turn to disrupt RED's production
3. Next turn, aim to upgrade settlement to city at node 36 if I have enough resources
4. Be ready to block RED with the robber if I get a knight
</plan>

Since RED is at 9 VP with 12 cards in hand, they're likely planning their winning move. I need to be tactical. The development card offers the best chance of either getting to 8 VP immediately (if it's a VP card) or getting a knight to disrupt RED's plans.

Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state and determine the optimal move based on the ore-wheat strategy.

## Game State Analysis
- BLUE (me): 7/10 VP (2 cities, 1 settlement, largest army)
- RED: 9/10 VP (2 cities, 3 settlements, longest road) - only needs 1 more VP to win!
- My resources: 1 sheep, 2 wheat, 2 ore
- RED has 12 hidden resource cards - a dangerously large hand

## Victory Path Assessment
RED is clearly one point away from winning and has a large hand of resources. They could potentially:
1. Build another settlement (10 VP)
2. Upgrade a settlement to a city (10 VP)
3. Buy a development card that might be a VP card

## My Available Actions
1. Buy a development card (1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore)
2-5. Various port trades that don't seem immediately useful

## Strategic Reasoning
The development card is my only meaningful option this turn. Here's why it's critical:
- Potential immediate benefits:
  - VP card (25% chance) would put me at 8 VP
  - Knight (40% chance) would strengthen my largest army lead and let me move the robber
  - Year of Plenty or Monopoly (35% chance) could help accelerate my city upgrade

- RED is about to win, and I need to play defensively while advancing my position
- I need to keep my ore-wheat strategy going - upgrading my settlement to a city soon is essential
- Buying a development card preserves my wheat and ore core strategy while giving me a chance at direct advancement

<plan>
1. Buy a development card now (hoping for VP or knight)
2. If I get a knight, use it next turn to disrupt RED's production (especially on their 8 sheep/6 wood hex)
3. Keep accumulating ore and wheat to upgrade my settlement at node 36 to a city
4. Keep disrupting RED while racing to 10 VP before they can recover
</plan>

Since RED is so close to winning, taking my one meaningful action is essential. The development card provides my best chance to both advance my position and potentially disrupt RED's near-win situation.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 1 | Player: BLUE | Action: BUILD_INITIAL_SETTLEMENT

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Buy a development card now (hoping for VP or knight)
2. If I get a knight, use it next turn to disrupt RED's production (especially on their 8 sheep/6 wood hex)
3. Keep accumulating ore and wheat to upgrade my settlement at node 36 to a city
4. Keep disrupting RED while racing to 10 VP before they can recover
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Analyzing Initial Settlement Placement

I need to carefully analyze the game state to make an optimal first settlement placement following the ore-wheat strategy. This is a critical decision that will impact the entire game.

## Step 1: Identify High-Value Nodes
I'm looking for nodes that connect to:
- Strong ore and wheat hexes (ideally with 6, 8, 5, 9 probabilities)
- Multiple resource types (for diversification)
- Highest pip count (probability dots)

## Step 2: Evaluate Top Candidate Nodes
Let's examine the best options:

### Node 36:
- Resources: Sheep (8 - high probability), Ore (4 - medium-low)
- Pip count: 5 (⭐⭐⭐ for sheep, ⭐⭐ for ore)
- Has access to a 3:1 port
- Good ore access, but ore is only probability 4

### Node 17:
- Resources: Wheat (10), Ore (4), Brick (12)
- Pip count: 3 (⭐⭐ for wheat, ⭐ for brick, ⭐ for ore)
- Balanced resources but lower probabilities

### Node 23:
- Resources: Wood (9), Ore (8), Brick (9)
- Pip count: 7 (⭐⭐⭐ for ore, ⭐⭐ for brick, ⭐⭐ for wood)
- Strong ore hex (8) - excellent for ore strategy
- Brick port nearby for future trading

### Node 49:
- Resources: Ore (8), Wheat (11), Sheep (3)
- Pip count: 6 (⭐⭐⭐ for ore, ⭐ for sheep, ⭐⭐ for wheat)
- Strong ore (8) and decent wheat (11)
- Access to 2:1 ore port for efficient trading
- Perfect for ore-wheat strategy

## Step 3: Final Decision
Node 49 stands out as the best choice because:
1. It has the crucial ore (8) with high probability
2. It includes wheat (11) - essential for our ore-wheat strategy
3. It's on an opposite side from RED's settlement (diversification)
4. It's adjacent to the 2:1 ore port which will be extremely valuable
5. Total pip count is excellent at 6

<plan>
1. Place first settlement at node 49 for strong ore (8) and wheat (11) production
2. Place my second settlement at a node with strong wheat and other resources I lack
3. Focus early game on upgrading the settlement at node 49 to a city
4. Use the ore port to efficiently trade excess ore for needed resources
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I choose node 49 for my initial settlement.

- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 1 | Player: BLUE | Action: BUILD_INITIAL_ROAD

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Place first settlement at node 49 for strong ore (8) and wheat (11) production
2. Place my second settlement at a node with strong wheat and other resources I lack
3. Focus early game on upgrading the settlement at node 49 to a city
4. Use the ore port to efficiently trade excess ore for needed resources

# Analyzing the Game State - Initial Road Placement

I need to make my first initial road placement for my settlement at node 49. This is a critical decision that will determine my future expansion options.

## Current Settlement Analysis
- My settlement at node 49 produces:
  - Wheat (11) - low probability but important for my ore-wheat strategy
  - Ore (8) - excellent high-probability production (⭐⭐⭐)
- I also have access to the 2:1 Ore port at node 49, which will be valuable for trading excess ore

## Road Options Analysis
Let me analyze each possible road placement:

[0] Build a road at edge (48, 49):
- This leads toward node 48, which connects to:
  - The wheat (11) hex I'm already on
  - The 2:1 wheat port (nodes 45, 47)
- Potential expansion value: MODERATE (redundant resource but port access)

[1] Build a road at edge (22, 49):
- This leads toward node 22, which connects to:
  - Sheep (3) - very low probability
  - Ore (8) - already have this resource
  - Wheat (11) - already have this resource
- Potential expansion value: LOW (poor resource diversity, low probability)

[2] Build a road at edge (49, 50):
- This leads toward node 50, which connects to:
  - Ore (8) - already have this resource
  - Would ultimately lead toward nodes 51/52 which have access to brick (9)
- Potential expansion value: HIGH (provides path to brick, which I will need)

## Strategic Considerations
- I need to ensure I can expand to get resources I lack (particularly wood and brick for future building)
- The ore-wheat strategy focuses on upgrading to cities quickly, which requires ore and wheat
- I already have good ore production, but will need other resources to expand initially

<plan>
1. Build initial road toward node 50, aiming to secure brick resource
2. Place second settlement at a spot with strong wheat and wood production
3. Focus early game on upgrading the settlement at node 49 to a city
4. Use the ore port to efficiently trade excess ore for needed resources
</plan>

Road option [2] leading to node 50 gives me the best path toward securing brick resources, which will help me expand further. This aligns with my ore-wheat strategy by enabling me to build roads and settlements efficiently to secure the remaining resources I need.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

I need to choose the optimal location for my second initial settlement. Looking at the game state:

1. My first settlement is at node 49, which produces:
   - Wheat (11) - low probability but critical resource
   - Ore (8) - high probability and crucial for the ore-wheat strategy
   - I already have access to the 2:1 ore port

2. Key resources I'm missing:
   - Wood (needed for expansion)
   - Brick (needed for expansion)
   - Sheep (needed for settlements and development cards)

3. I should prioritize:
   - High probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
   - Resource diversity to cover what I'm missing
   - Location on the opposite side of the board from my first settlement

Let me evaluate the best options:

## Node Analysis
- Node 3: Connects wheat(10), wood(3), wood(4) - Good wheat but mediocre wood probability
- Node 4: Connects wheat(10), wood(3), ore(4) - Adds low-prob ore when I already have good ore
- Node 13: Connects wheat(6), wood(5), sheep(8) - Excellent probabilities with 3 different resources
- Node 14: Connects sheep(8), ore(4), wheat(6) - Good sheep + wheat but redundant low-prob ore
- Node 15: Connects wheat(6), wheat(10), ore(4) - Too wheat-heavy
- Node 16: Connects wheat(10), sheep(6), wood(5) - Good resource mix but not optimal probability
- Node 17: Connects wheat(10), ore(4), brick(12) - Poor brick probability

Node 13 stands out with excellent probability numbers (6, 5, 8) and provides 3 different resources that complement my current settlement perfectly. It gives me access to the missing wood, sheep, and additional wheat from a high-probability hex.

<plan>
1. Place second settlement at node 13 to secure high-probability wheat(6), wood(5), and sheep(8)
2. Early game: Use wood+brick to build toward additional brick sources
3. Mid game: Prioritize upgrading both settlements to cities (node 49 first for ore production)
4. Use the ore port to trade excess ore for needed resources
5. Target Largest Army with sheep production from node 13
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I'll choose node 13 for my second initial settlement, which corresponds to action 11.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 1 | Player: BLUE | Action: BUILD_INITIAL_ROAD

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Place second settlement at node 13 to secure high-probability wheat(6), wood(5), and sheep(8)

# Game State Analysis

I need to choose where to place my initial road from my settlement at node 11. Let me evaluate each option carefully from the perspective of the ore-wheat strategy.

## Current Resources
- 2 wood
- No brick to build a road this turn

## Settlement Placements Analysis
- I have settlements at nodes 11 (wood 4, wood 5) and 49 (wheat 11, ore 8)
- My settlements give me good access to wood and ore, with some wheat
- Missing/limited access to: brick and sheep

## Road Placement Options
1. Edge (10, 11): Moves toward desert and sheep 9
2. Edge (11, 32): Moves toward wood port and desert
3. Edge (11, 12): Moves toward wheat 6 and wood 4

## Strategic Assessment
Looking at the board structure:
- Option 0 (10, 11): Leads toward sheep 9 (decent), but also toward the robber in the desert
- Option 1 (11, 32): Leads toward the wood port (less useful since I already have good wood production)
- Option 2 (11, 12): Leads toward the valuable wheat hex with a 6 (high probability) and additional wood

The most strategic road would build toward high-value resources I need, especially those that support the ore-wheat strategy.

<plan>
1. Place initial road toward node 12, aiming to eventually build a settlement at node 3 to secure wheat(6) and additional wood(4)
2. Early game: Gather resources to secure node 3 settlement, providing crucial wheat for city upgrades
3. Mid game: Prioritize upgrading both settlements to cities (node 49 first for ore production)
4. Use the ore port to trade excess ore for needed resources
5. Target Largest Army with development cards from ore/wheat/sheep production
</plan>

Option 2 (11, 12) is clearly the best choice as it:
- Moves toward the high-probability wheat hex (6) which is critical for my ore-wheat strategy
- Positions me to build toward node 3 which would give me access to wheat(6) and more wood(4)
- Aligns with my goal of securing more wheat for city upgrades
- Avoids moving toward the robber's current location
- Creates a path toward more promising expansion options

My plan is to place a settlement at node 3 to secure wheat (6) and wood (4), then upgrade my settlements to cities, starting with node 49 for better ore production. I have the ore port for flexible trading.

## Decision Process

Let me assess my options:

1. **End Turn (Action 0)**: I have 5 resources but not the right combination to build anything significant.
   - For a settlement: Need brick + wood + sheep + wheat
   - For a city: Need 3 ore + 2 wheat (I have 2 ore, 1 wheat)
   - For a development card: Need ore + wheat + sheep (I have 2 ore, 1 wheat)
   - For a road: Need brick + wood (I have 2 wood, but no brick)

2. **Maritime Trading (Actions 1-4)**:
   - Action 1: Give 2 None (?) for 1 Brick - This doesn't make sense as the description is unclear
   - Action 2: Give 2 None (?) for 1 Wheat - This doesn't make sense as the description is unclear
   - Action 3: Give 2 None (?) for 1 Sheep - This doesn't make sense as the description is unclear
   - Action 4: Give 2 None (?) for 1 Wood - This doesn't make sense as the description is unclear

I notice that the maritime trade options are strangely formatted. Looking at the ports information, I see I have access to the 2:1 Ore port at nodes 48, 49. This means I should be able to trade 2 Ore for 1 of any other resource.

Looking at what I need most:
- For city upgrade: I need 1 more wheat (already have 2 ore, 1 wheat)
- For road expansion: I need brick (already have 2 wood)
- For development card: I need sheep (already have 2 ore, 1 wheat)

Since I'm following the ore-wheat strategy with cities as priority, getting 1 more wheat would be most valuable as it would let me be just 1 ore away from a city upgrade.

It appears the maritime trade options might be mislabeled. If Action 2 is actually "Trade port: Give 2 ORE for 1 WHEAT" using my ore port, this would be my best option.

However, with the unclear descriptions and without the ability to verify what these trades actually are, the safest option is to end my turn (Action 0) and collect more resources on subsequent turns.

<plan>
1. End turn to collect more resources
2. Continue aiming to secure node 3 for additional wheat/wood production
3. Save resources for city upgrade at node 49 (need 3 ore, 2 wheat)
4. Use ore port strategically when I have excess ore
5. Build toward Largest Army through development cards when resources permit
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 7 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. End turn to collect more resources
2. Continue aiming to secure node 3 for additional wheat/wood production
3. Save resources for city upgrade at node 49 (need 3 ore, 2 wheat)
4. Use ore port strategically when I have excess ore
5. Build toward Largest Army through development cards when resources permit

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze the current game state and determine the best action:

## Current Resources Assessment
I currently have:
- 1 Wood
- 1 Wheat 
- 2 Ore
- No Sheep or Brick

## Victory Point Assessment
- I have 2 VP from 2 settlements
- RED also has 2 VP from 2 settlements
- We're both in early-mid game phase

## Building Possibilities
- I don't have enough resources for a city (need 3 ore + 2 wheat)
- I don't have enough for a settlement (need 1 brick + 1 wood + 1 sheep + 1 wheat)
- I don't have enough for a road (need 1 brick + 1 wood)
- I don't have enough for a development card (need 1 ore + 1 wheat + 1 sheep)

## Port Analysis
I have access to a 2:1 ore port at nodes 48, 49. I could trade 2 ore for 1 of another resource.

## Strategy Evaluation
Looking at my current plan:
1. I want to upgrade node 49 to a city (need 3 ore, 2 wheat) - I'm on my way with 2 ore, 1 wheat
2. I want to secure node 3 for wheat/wood production
3. I need to collect more resources before I can make meaningful progress

None of my maritime trade options make sense now:
- I don't have enough ore (need 4) to trade for 2 resources I need
- I need to keep my existing resources toward my city upgrade goal

## Decision
Since I cannot make any productive builds or trades with my current resources, the optimal play is to end my turn and collect more resources. This aligns with the ore-wheat city-focused strategy, as I'm working toward a city upgrade.

<plan>
1. End turn to collect more resources
2. Continue aiming to secure node 3 for additional wheat/wood production
3. Save resources for city upgrade at node 49 (need 3 ore, 2 wheat)
4. Use ore port strategically when I have excess ore
5. Build toward Largest Army through development cards when resources permit

- 2 points (2 settlements)

## Settlement and Road Positions:
- Settlements at nodes 49 (producing wheat-11 and ore-8) and 11 (producing wood-4 and wood-5)
- Roads at (49, 50), (11, 12)

## Strategic Assessment:

1) **City Upgrade Potential:**
   - Need 3 ore and 2 wheat for a city upgrade
   - I have 3 ore and 1 wheat, so I'm only 1 wheat short for a city upgrade
   - City upgrade at node 49 (ore-8 and wheat-11) would be ideal as it's a high-value location

2) **Maritime Trade Options:**
   - Action [2] allows trading 2 ore for 1 wheat using my ore port (nodes 48, 49)
   - This would give me exactly the resources needed for a city upgrade

3) **Next Turn Planning:**
   - By ending my turn now (action 0), I'd be gambling on rolling wheat next turn
   - Building a city immediately secures 1 more VP and doubles production at node 49

## Decision Logic:

The ore-wheat strategy emphasizes city upgrades as the highest priority. I have 3 ore right now, which is exactly what I need for a city. I only need one more wheat to be able to build a city at node 49.

Since I have access to the ore port, I can trade 2 ore for 1 wheat. This will leave me with 1 ore and 2 wheat - exactly what I need to upgrade my settlement at node 49 to a city.

This is clearly the optimal play as:
1) It advances my victory points immediately (+1 VP)
2) It doubles production at a high-value node (8-ore and 11-wheat)
3) It follows the ore-wheat strategy of prioritizing city upgrades
4) It converts resources directly into permanent game advantage

<plan>
1. Trade 2 ore for 1 wheat using the ore port
2. Build a city at node 49 to double ore/wheat production
3. Focus on building toward node 3 for additional resource diversity
4. Consider development cards for potential VPs and largest army
5. Aim for a second city at node 11 once resources are available
</plan>

The clear choice is to use maritime trade to get the wheat I need:

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 13 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Trade 2 ore for 1 wheat using the ore port
2. Build a city at node 49 to double ore/wheat production
3. Focus on building toward node 3 for additional resource diversity
4. Consider development cards for potential VPs and largest army
5. Aim for a second city at node 11 once resources are available

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

## Current Situation Assessment
I'm playing as BLUE with:
- 2 Victory Points (2 settlements)
- Resources: 2 wood, 2 wheat, 2 ore
- Settlements at node 49 (producing wheat 11, ore 8) and node 11 (producing wood 4, wood 5)
- I have access to a 2:1 ore port at node 49

## Strategic Options Analysis

Looking at my resources, I have:
- 2 ore + 2 wheat + 2 wood
- This is not enough for a city (3 ore + 2 wheat needed)
- I don't have enough for a settlement (1 wood + 1 brick + 1 wheat + 1 sheep needed)
- I don't have enough to buy a development card (1 ore + 1 wheat + 1 sheep needed)

My available actions are:
- Trade using my 2:1 ore port 
- End my turn

Since I have 2 ore, I could use my ore port to trade for another resource. My opponent has 10 hidden cards and seems to be doing well with resource production, so I need to advance my position.

## Maritime Trade Decision

Looking at my existing plan, I want to:
1. Build a city at node 49 to double ore/wheat production
2. Build toward node 3 for resource diversity

To build a city, I need 3 ore (I have 2) and 2 wheat (I have 2). I'm only 1 ore short!

Given my access to the 2:1 ore port, and my current resources, the optimal choice is:

**Option 2: Trade 2 ore for 1 wheat**

But wait - that doesn't make strategic sense. I already have 2 wheat, and trading ore for wheat when I need ore for a city would be counterproductive. I should save my resources for next turn when I might roll more ore.

<plan>
1. Save resources to build a city at node 49 ASAP (need 1 more ore)
2. Continue focus on building toward node 3 for resource diversity once city is built
3. Consider development cards for VPs and largest army after securing city production
4. Aim for second city at node 11 once first city is established
</plan>

The most optimal play is to end my turn and wait for more resources.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze my current position and options:

- 3 wood, 1 wheat, 2 ore

## Strategic Position:
- I have 2 settlements (2 VP)
- I need 3 more ore to upgrade a settlement to a city (need 3 ore, 2 wheat - I have 2 ore, 1 wheat)
- I have an ore port at node 49 where one of my settlements is located
- My previous plan was to save resources for a city at node 49 (need 1 more ore)

## Available Actions:
0. End turn
1-4. Maritime trades using my ore port (2:1 ratio)

## Decision Analysis:

Looking at my resources and my plan, I'm trying to build a city at node 49 which requires 3 ore and 2 wheat. I currently have:
- 2 ore (need 1 more)
- 1 wheat (need 1 more)
- 3 wood (not needed for city)

I have access to a 2:1 ore port, which means I can trade 2 ore for any 1 resource. However, this doesn't make sense right now because:
1. I need to accumulate ore, not trade it away
2. I still don't have enough ore (3) to build a city
3. Trading ore for wheat is counter-productive to my ore-wheat strategy

Since I can't make any productive builds or trades this turn, the best action is to end my turn and hope for better dice rolls. I need to keep accumulating resources toward my city upgrade.

<plan>
1. Save resources to build a city at node 49 (need 1 more ore, 1 more wheat)
2. Use my ore port strategically only when I have excess ore
3. Continue focus on building toward node 3 once city is built
4. Consider development cards if I accumulate excess sheep
5. Aim for second city at node 11 after first city is established
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze the current game state and determine the optimal move for our ore-wheat strategy.

## Current Assessment
- I have 2 VP (2 settlements)
- Resources: 4 🌲Wood, 1 🌾Wheat, 2 ⛏️Ore
- Red has 3 VP (3 settlements)
- I need 1 ore and 1 wheat to build a city at node 49

## Action Options
I currently have these resources and need to advance my "city-focused" strategy:
- Current resources: 4 🌲Wood, 1 🌾Wheat, 2 ⛏️Ore
- For a city, I need: 3 ⛏️Ore, 2 🌾Wheat
- So I'm short: 1 ⛏️Ore, 1 🌾Wheat

Looking at the available actions:
- Option 4: Trade 4 🌲Wood for 1 ⛏️Ore
- Option 8: Trade 4 🌲Wood for 1 🌾Wheat

Since I have 4 wood, I can make exactly one trade. The question is whether to get ore or wheat.

## Decision Process
1. My current plan is to build a city at node 49, which requires 1 more ore and 1 more wheat
2. I can only trade for one resource this turn (either ore or wheat)
3. I have the ore port at nodes 48,49, which means I'll be able to trade ore at 2:1 in the future
4. Based on probability, my ore income is more reliable (⛏️8 at node 49) than my wheat income (only 🌾11 at node 49, which is less likely to roll)

Since I have good ore production but limited wheat production, and have the ore port for efficient future trading, I should prioritize getting the wheat now.

## Strategic Decision
I'll trade 4 wood for 1 wheat. This will give me 2 wheat total, which is one of my required resources for the city upgrade. Next turn, I'll only need 1 more ore to build the city.

<plan>
1. Trade wood for wheat this turn to secure 2/2 wheat needed for city at node 49
2. Next turn focus on getting 1 more ore (I already have 2/3 needed)
3. Build city at node 49 ASAP to double my ore production
4. After city is built, use ore port to help with future builds
5. Continue expansion toward node 3 to improve wheat production
6. Consider development cards if excess sheep becomes available
</plan>

The optimal action is:

- Resources: 2 wheat, 2 ore
- I need 1 more ore and 0 more wheat to build a city (total cost: 3 ore, 2 wheat)
- I have an ore port at node 49 where I have a settlement
- My current plan is to upgrade a settlement to a city at node 49 to double ore production

## Current Resources Analysis
- I'm close to building a city (just need 1 more ore)
- I have NO wood, brick or sheep currently

## Action Options
0. End turn - Would mean not using my current resources or making progress
1-4. Maritime trades - Can use my ore port to trade for other resources

## Strategic Considerations
- My settlement at node 49 produces ore (on 8) and wheat (on 11)
- Upgrading this to a city would double my ore production, which is crucial for the ore-wheat strategy
- I currently have no way to get the additional ore I need without trading

## Decision Process
Since I have access to the ore port (2:1) at node 49, I could trade 2 ore for another resource. However, that would leave me with only 0 ore, putting me further away from my city goal. 

According to my plan, I wanted to trade wood for wheat, but I actually already have the 2 wheat I need for a city. What I'm missing is 1 more ore. The available maritime trades (actions 1-4) would mean giving up my ore, which is counterproductive.

Therefore, the best decision is to end my turn and hope to get the 1 additional ore I need from dice rolls next turn.

<plan>
1. Hold my 2 ore and 2 wheat for now
2. Wait to collect 1 more ore to build a city at node 49
3. After city is built, use ore port to help with future builds
4. Continue expansion toward node 3 to improve wheat production
5. Consider development cards if excess sheep becomes available
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game State Analysis

First, let me assess the current game state:

**My Position:**
- I have 2 VP (2 settlements)
- Resources: 1 wood, 2 wheat, 2 ore
- Settlements at nodes 49 (wheat-11, ore-8) and 11 (wood-5, wood-4)
- Access to 2:1 ore port at node 49

**Opponent Position:**
- RED has 3 VP (3 settlements)
- RED has 7 hidden resource cards
- RED has settlements producing wheat, wood, sheep, ore, and brick

**Current Plan Review:**
My current plan is to collect one more ore to upgrade my settlement at node 49 to a city. This is perfectly aligned with the ore-wheat strategy, which prioritizes city upgrades.

## Decision Analysis

Let me evaluate my options:
1. End turn
2-4. Maritime trading options

**Option 0: End Turn**
- I need 1 more ore to upgrade my settlement at node 49 to a city
- I currently have 2 ore, 2 wheat, 1 wood - enough for a development card, but not enough for a city
- No obvious trades make sense here as I'm focused on collecting ore
- I don't need to build roads right now as my priority is the city upgrade

**Options 1-4: Maritime Trade**
- I have access to a 2:1 ore port, but I need ore, not to trade it away
- None of these trades help me get the third ore I need for a city
- Trading away my current resources would set me back from my city goal

## Strategic Considerations

1. City upgrade remains my top priority following the ore-wheat strategy
2. I already have 2 of the 3 ore needed, and 2 of the 2 wheat needed
3. Trading away resources would be counterproductive to my goal
4. RED has 7 resources - risk of a robber move if a 7 is rolled, but I'm not at risk with only 5 cards

<plan>
1. End turn and continue collecting resources
2. Build city at node 49 once I have 3 ore + 2 wheat
3. After city upgrade, leverage the ore port strategically
4. Consider development cards if I collect excess sheep
5. Plan expansion toward nodes that improve wheat and ore production
</plan>

The optimal move is to end my turn and continue with resource collection toward my city upgrade goal. No trades make sense as they would delay my city build.

# Game Analysis for Turn 21

I'll analyze the current game state to determine my optimal move as the BLUE player.

## Current Game Situation
- **My Resources**: 1 wood, 3 wheat, 2 ore
- **Victory Points**: 2/10 (2 settlements)
- **Current Plan**: Working toward a city at node 49, need 3 ore + 2 wheat
- **Key Income**: I have settlements on good ore (8) and wood (5, 4) production, but limited wheat

## Resource Analysis
- I have 2 ore and 3 wheat, so I'm only 1 ore short of being able to build a city
- I have access to an ore port at nodes 48, 49 (where I have a settlement)

## Decision Options
1. **End turn**: Collect more resources next round
2. **Maritime trade**: Trading via my ore port (2:1) or the general port (3:1)

## Trade Option Analysis
- I could trade 2 ore for 1 brick or 1 sheep or 1 wood through the ore port
- But this would deplete my ore supply, setting me back on my city upgrade goal
- I need 1 more ore for my city upgrade, which is my priority 

## Strategic Considerations
- The ore-wheat strategy prioritizes city upgrades
- I'm very close to my first city (just 1 ore short)
- Trading away ore or wheat would contradict my core strategy
- Ending my turn preserves my resources and keeps me on track for my city upgrade

<plan>
1. End turn to preserve current resources
2. Build city at node 49 once I collect 1 more ore (already have 2 ore + 3 wheat)
3. After city upgrade, leverage the ore port strategically
4. Consider development cards if I collect excess sheep
5. Plan expansion toward nodes that improve wheat and ore production
</plan>

Since I'm only 1 ore away from building my first city, and I'm following the ore-wheat strategy that prioritizes city upgrades, the optimal move is to end my turn and maintain my resources for my city upgrade.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

I need to decide where to place the robber to maximize my chances of winning through the ore-wheat strategy. Let me analyze the situation:

## Current Position Analysis
- I'm at 2/10 VP with 2 settlements
- I have 2 wood, 3 wheat, 2 ore (close to building a city - need 3 ore, 2 wheat)
- I have access to the 2:1 ore port at node 49 (one of my settlements)
- My current plan is to build a city at node 49 once I get 1 more ore

## Opponent Analysis
- RED has 3 VP and 6 hidden cards
- RED has settlements at nodes 13, 15, and 23
- RED has good wheat and sheep production

## Resource Needs
I need 1 more ore to build my first city at node 49. This is critical for my ore-wheat strategy.

## Robber Placement Options
Looking at hexes controlled by RED with high production value:
- Hex (-1, 0, 1) with wheat 6: This is a valuable wheat hex for RED with 3 dots
- Hex (-2, 0, 2) with sheep 8: High-value sheep hex with 3 dots
- Hex (2, 0, -2) with ore 8: This is a high-value ore hex with 3 dots that RED can access

The ore hex (2, 0, -2) is also connected to my settlement at node 49, so placing the robber there would hurt my own production. That's not a good choice.

Given my ore-wheat strategy and need for resources, I should target one of RED's productive hexes and try to steal potentially useful resources.

The wheat hex (-1, 0, 1) with a 6 (3 dots) is a strong target since:
1. It's one of RED's most productive hexes (high probability number)
2. It would block a key resource for RED (wheat is crucial for cities)
3. I might steal wheat or ore from RED, which would help me build my city

Option [3] is to move the robber to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED, which directly supports my city-building plan.

<plan>
1. Move robber to wheat hex (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED
2. Build city at node 49 once I collect 1 more ore (already have 2 ore + 3 wheat)
3. After city upgrade, leverage the ore port strategically
4. Consider development cards if I collect excess sheep
5. Plan expansion toward nodes that improve wheat and ore production
</plan>

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze the current game state and make the optimal decision based on the ore-wheat strategy.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 2 VP (2 settlements)
- RED has 3 VP (3 settlements)
- I have 2 WOOD, 3 WHEAT, and 3 ORE
- I can build a city (costs 2 WHEAT, 3 ORE)
- The robber is on a wheat hex (-1, 0, 1) which is a 6 (high-value)

## Strategic Analysis
The ore-wheat strategy prioritizes city building. I currently have exactly the resources needed to build a city.

Looking at my settlement options:
1. Node 49: Produces WHEAT (11) and ORE (8) - high value ORE production
2. Node 11: Produces WOOD (4) and WOOD (5) - only wood

My current plan already identified upgrading node 49 to a city as the priority, which is exactly right. Node 49 is clearly the better choice as:
- It produces ORE (8) which is a high-probability hex (5 pips)
- Upgrading it doubles my ORE production, which is essential for the ore-wheat strategy
- It has access to the 2:1 ORE port, giving me trading flexibility
- WHEAT (11) is also valuable for future city building

## Action Analysis
I have exactly the resources needed to build a city at node 49, which will:
- Increase my VP from 2 to 3
- Double my ORE production from the valuable 8 hex
- Work toward my city-focused strategy (ore-wheat)

No reason to delay this move. Building a city is the optimal play in the ore-wheat strategy, and node 49 is the perfect location.

<plan>
1. Build city at node 49 (done)
2. Focus on getting enough resources for another city at node 11
3. Look for opportunities to build a settlement at a location with good wheat production
4. Consider development cards with excess sheep
5. Utilize the ore port for efficient trading when needed
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Robber Placement

I need to analyze the best robber placement to support my ore-wheat strategy and hinder my opponent.

## Key Considerations:
1. Which hex will disrupt my opponent's key resource production?
2. Which hex allows me to steal a potentially useful resource?
3. Which resources am I most in need of (ore and wheat for cities)?

## Analyzing RED's Production:
- RED has settlements at nodes 13, 23, and 15
- RED produces from:
  - 🌾Wheat: 6(⭐⭐⭐) and 10(⭐)
  - 🌲Wood: 5(⭐⭐)
  - 🐑Sheep: 8(⭐⭐⭐) and 3(⭐)
  - ⛏️Ore: 8(⭐⭐⭐) and 4(⭐)
  - 🧱Brick: 9(⭐⭐)

## Best Hex to Block:
Looking at high-probability numbers AND resources that RED needs:
- The 🌾6 wheat hex is already blocked
- The ⛏️8 ore hex is extremely valuable (coordinates: (2, 0, -2))
  - This would block RED's access to high-probability ore
  - This is crucial for city upgrades RED might plan
  - It's worth 3 pips (⭐⭐⭐) - very high probability

## My Resource Needs:
I need ore and wheat for my city strategy. Blocking RED's ore access would be ideal and aligns with my plan to focus on upgrading settlements to cities.

## Final Decision:
I should place the robber on the ⛏️8 ore hex at (2, 0, -2) and steal from RED. This corresponds to action [16].

<plan>
1. Keep my city at node 49
2. Block RED's ore production to slow them down
3. Focus on gathering ore/wheat to upgrade node 11 to a city
4. Consider expanding to get access to wheat production
5. Use my ore port for efficient trades when needed
</plan>

# Analyzing the Game State and Robber Placement Options

I need to decide where to place the robber to maximize my chances of winning through the ore-wheat strategy. Let me analyze the current game state:

## Game State Assessment
- I have 3 VP (1 city + 1 settlement)
- RED has 3 VP (3 settlements)
- RED has significant resource production advantage with 3 settlements vs my 1 city + 1 settlement
- My hand: 3 wood, 3 wheat, 1 ore
- I need more ore to upgrade my settlement at node 11 to a city

## Key Considerations for Robber Placement:
1. Block RED's high-value production, especially ore/wheat
2. Target hexes where RED has multiple settlements
3. Maximize chances of stealing useful resources (ore/wheat)

## Analyzing RED's Production
RED has settlements at nodes 13, 15, and 23 producing:
- Node 13: Wheat-6, Wood-5, Sheep-8
- Node 15: Wheat-6, Wheat-10, Ore-4
- Node 23: Sheep-3, Ore-8, Brick-9

Notably, RED has access to wheat-6 from TWO settlements (13 and 15), and their ore-8 hex is currently blocked by the robber already.

## Best Robber Placement Options:

- **Option [3] - Move to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED**:
  - This is the wheat-6 hex that serves TWO of RED's settlements (13 and 15)
  - Blocks a high-probability wheat hex (6 has 5 dots)
  - Has good chance of stealing wheat from RED
  - *Very strong option as it blocks multiple RED settlements and a key resource*

- **Option [4] - Move to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED**:
  - This is the wheat-10 hex connected to RED's settlement at node 15
  - Blocks a decent wheat production (10 has 3 dots)
  - Good option, but affects only one RED settlement

- **Option [10] - Move to (-1, -1, 2) and steal from RED**:
  - This is the wood-5 hex connected to RED's settlement at node 13
  - Would block decent wood production (5 has 4 dots)
  - Useful but not as impactful as blocking wheat

- **Option [11] - Move to (-2, 0, 2) and steal from RED**:
  - This is the sheep-8 hex connected to RED's settlement at node 13
  - Would block high-probability sheep production (8 has 5 dots)
  - Good option but sheep is less critical than wheat for city building

## Decision-Making
For my ore-wheat strategy, I want to:
1. Disrupt RED's wheat production to slow their progress
2. Potentially gain wheat myself through stealing
3. Target hexes that affect multiple settlements for maximum impact

Option [3] achieves these goals best by blocking RED's wheat-6 hex that feeds two of their settlements. This blocks a high-probability resource that RED needs for city upgrades and development cards.

<plan>
1. Place robber on wheat-6 hex to disrupt RED's production at two settlements
2. Continue gathering ore/wheat to upgrade node 11 to a city
3. Consider building roads toward a wheat hex for future settlement expansion
4. Use my ore port strategically to trade for needed resources
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Place robber on wheat-6 hex to disrupt RED's production at two settlements
2. Continue gathering ore/wheat to upgrade node 11 to a city

# Game Analysis for Turn 27

Let me analyze my current position and available actions:

## Current Game State
- I have 3 VP (1 from settlement, 2 from city)
- Resources: 3 Wood, 1 Sheep, 3 Wheat, 1 Ore
- RED has 3 VP (all from settlements)
- I control a 2:1 Ore port which is very valuable
- The robber is on a wheat-6 tile that RED uses

## Available Actions
1. Buy a development card (costs 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore)
2. End turn

## Strategic Analysis
Looking at my resources, I don't have enough to build a road (need brick), settlement (need brick), or city (need more ore). 

My current plan mentions gathering ore/wheat to upgrade node 11 to a city. This is a good plan as it would give me another 2 VP and better production. However, I currently lack sufficient ore for this.

Buying a development card has several potential benefits:
- Could be a Victory Point card (immediate hidden VP)
- Could be a Knight, which helps toward Largest Army (2VP)
- Could be a helpful action card (Year of Plenty, Road Building, or Monopoly)

Development cards align well with my ore-wheat strategy as they could provide hidden VP or knights that protect my high-value hexes.

## Decision Process
With my current resources, I can buy a development card while still having some resources left:
- Current: 3 Wood, 1 Sheep, 3 Wheat, 1 Ore
- After purchase: 3 Wood, 0 Sheep, 2 Wheat, 0 Ore

This maintains my progress toward winning while still having resources for trading. Development cards are also hidden from my opponent, giving me a strategic advantage.

<plan>
1. Buy a development card this turn
2. Continue gathering ore/wheat to upgrade node 11 to a city
3. Use my ore port strategically for trading
4. Consider expanding toward a new settlement location that provides brick (which I'm currently lacking)
</plan>

After careful consideration of my options and resources, I choose to:

# Game Analysis for Turn 29

Let me analyze the current game state and available actions:

## Current Game State
- I have 3 VP (1 settlement, 1 city, 1 VP card)
- I have 4 wood and 2 wheat resources
- I need to focus on city building (ore+wheat strategy)
- My city is at node 49 (produces ore on 8)
- My settlement is at node 11 (produces wood on 4 and 5)
- I have access to a 2:1 ore port at node 49

## Resource Analysis
- I have 4 wood and 2 wheat
- I need ore to upgrade my settlement to a city
- I don't have enough resources to build anything substantial
- Red has 4 hidden resources
- The robber is on a wheat hex (-1, 0, 1) with production number 6

## Action Options
1-4: Trade 4 wood for 1 resource (wheat, ore, sheep, or brick)
0: End turn

## Decision Analysis
With 4 wood, I can trade at the standard 4:1 rate to obtain any resource. Given my ore-wheat strategy:

- Option 2 (get ore): Ore is my most needed resource for city building. Trading for ore would give me 1 ore which isn't enough for a city yet, but positions me better for future builds.

- Option 1 (get wheat): I already have 2 wheat, and getting 1 more wouldn't enable any immediate builds.

- Options 3/4 (get sheep/brick): These resources aren't priorities for my city-focused strategy.

- Option 0 (end turn): I could save my wood for future turns, but there's risk in holding too many cards.

Trading my wood for ore (option 2) is most aligned with my city strategy. Even though I can't build immediately, having 1 ore puts me closer to my next city upgrade at node 11.

<plan>
1. Trade wood for ore this turn
2. Continue gathering ore/wheat to upgrade node 11 to a city
3. Use my ore port strategically once I have more ore
4. Consider expanding toward a settlement location with brick production when possible
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 31 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Trade wood for ore this turn
2. Continue gathering ore/wheat to upgrade node 11 to a city
3. Use my ore port strategically once I have more ore
4. Consider expanding toward a settlement location with brick production when possible
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis for Turn 31

Let me analyze the current game state and my available options carefully:

## Current Game Status
- I (BLUE) have 3 VP: 1 settlement (1 VP), 1 city (2 VP), and 1 hidden VP card
- RED has 5 VP: 3 settlements (3 VP) plus Longest Road (2 VP)
- I have 2 WHEAT and 3 ORE in hand
- I have an ore port at node 49 where my city is located

## Available Actions
0. End turn
1. Upgrade settlement to city at node 11 (Cost: 2 WHEAT, 3 ORE)
2-5. Maritime trades (none useful with my current resources)

## Strategic Analysis

The most important option is upgrading my settlement at node 11 to a city. This would:
1. Increase my VP from 3 to 4
2. Double my production of wood (node 11 produces wood on 4 and 5)
3. Consume all my resources but make efficient use of them

My settlement at node 11 produces wood on rolls of 4 and 5, which are decent production numbers. Upgrading to a city would double this production, helping me acquire more wood for future roads and settlements.

Looking at my overall position:
- I need to build more roads and settlements to catch up with RED
- I currently lack brick production, which is a weakness
- Upgrading to a city aligns with the ore-wheat strategy and increases my resource income

## Decision

I have exactly the resources needed for a city (2 WHEAT, 3 ORE), which is the cornerstone of the ore-wheat strategy. This is a perfect opportunity to execute the strategy by upgrading my settlement to increase my resource production and gain a VP.

<plan>
1. Upgrade node 11 to a city this turn
2. Next focus on acquiring brick and wood to build roads
3. Aim to establish a new settlement at a location that produces brick
4. Continue working toward largest army or more cities
</plan>

# Game Analysis for Blue Player

I need to carefully analyze my current position and options to determine the optimal next move.

## Current Game State Assessment

- **My Victory Points (4/10)**: 
  - 2 cities (4 VP)
  - 1 hidden victory point card (1 VP)
  - Need 5 more VP to win

- **My Resources**: 4 wheat and nothing else
- **Current Production**: Two cities producing wood, wheat and ore (strong ore-wheat strategy foundation)
- **Opponent**: Red has 5 VP including 2 VP from longest road, 3 settlements, and 6 cards in hand

## Strategic Analysis

Looking at my current plan, I wanted to upgrade node 11 to a city, but I already have a city there. There seems to be a discrepancy in the plan, as node 11 is already listed as a city in the BUILDINGS section.

My current resources (4 wheat) are not enough to build anything significant:
- City requires: 3 ore + 2 wheat
- Settlement requires: 1 brick + 1 wood + 1 wheat + 1 sheep
- Development card requires: 1 ore + 1 wheat + 1 sheep
- Road requires: 1 brick + 1 wood

<plan>
1. End this turn as I can't make any productive trades or builds with just 4 wheat
2. Next turn, focus on acquiring ore, brick and wood through production or beneficial trades
3. Aim to build roads and a settlement at a location that produces brick (critical missing resource)
4. Continue working toward largest army (need knights) or more cities when possible
</plan>

Given my resource limitations, the only options available are maritime trades. However, trading 4 wheat for 1 of any resource is extremely inefficient, especially when wheat is one of my core resources for the ore-wheat strategy. With just 4 wheat, I'd be depleting my entire hand for a single resource that wouldn't allow me to build anything.

The optimal move is to end my turn and wait for better resource production on future rolls. Preserving my wheat is better than making a poor trade.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game State Analysis

Let me carefully analyze the current game state:

## Current Resources & Victory Points
- I have: 2 WOOD, 3 WHEAT, 2 ORE
- Current VP: 4/10 (2 cities = 4 VP, plus 1 hidden VP card)
- RED has 6 VP (4 settlements + longest road)

## Board Position
- I have 2 cities: node 49 (produces WHEAT and ORE) and node 11 (produces WOOD)
- I lack BRICK and SHEEP production entirely
- I have access to the 2:1 ORE port at node 49
- RED is ahead by 2 VP and has more diverse resource production

## Available Actions
I can either end my turn (option 0) or make maritime trades (options 1-4).

## Strategic Considerations
1. I don't have enough resources to build anything this turn:
   - Settlement = 1 BRICK, 1 WOOD, 1 WHEAT, 1 SHEEP (missing BRICK and SHEEP)
   - Road = 1 BRICK, 1 WOOD (missing BRICK)
   - Development Card = 1 ORE, 1 WHEAT, 1 SHEEP (missing SHEEP)
   - City = 3 ORE, 2 WHEAT (not enough resources)

2. The maritime trades don't make strategic sense right now:
   - Option 1 (get BRICK): I'd need to trade 2 resources, but I need to save my current resources
   - Options 2-4: Trading for resources I already have would be wasteful

3. Since I cannot make any productive moves this turn, it makes sense to end my turn (option 0) and hope for better resource production next turn.

<plan>
1. End this turn as I can't make any productive builds or trades
2. On next turn, aim to collect more resources, especially BRICK and SHEEP (my missing resources)
3. Work toward building a settlement at a location that produces BRICK and/or SHEEP
4. Continue focusing on development cards if SHEEP becomes available
5. Longer term: reach 10 VP through cities (4 VP), settlements (2 VP), largest army (2 VP), and VP cards (2 VP)
</plan>

Based on my analysis, the best action is to end my turn.

# Analysis of Game State and Available Options

## Current Game Status
- I have 4 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + 1 hidden VP card
- RED has 7 VP: 3 settlements (3 VP) + 1 city (2 VP) + longest road (2 VP)
- I have 2 wood, 3 wheat, 4 ore
- I'm lacking brick and sheep, which limits my build options

## Available Actions
- [0] End Turn
- [1-4] Maritime Trade options using my 2:1 ore port

## Action Analysis

Let me review my build priorities and options:
1. I can't build a settlement (need brick + wood + wheat + sheep)
2. I can't build a city (already upgraded my only settlements)
3. I can't build a road (need brick + wood)
4. I can't buy development cards (need ore + wheat + sheep)

The maritime trade options would use my 2:1 ore port to get brick, wheat, sheep or wood. I already have sufficient wheat (3) and wood (2), so those trades don't make sense. I need brick and sheep, but:
- Trading for a single brick or sheep won't enable me to build anything this turn
- Better to save my resources for more efficient use later

## Strategic Considerations
- RED is at 7 VP and likely to win soon
- I need to save my resources for a big move next turn
- Trading away resources now without being able to build anything is inefficient
- My best path to victory is upgrading to more cities, but I've already upgraded my settlements
- I need to expand with a new settlement to get access to brick and sheep

<plan>
1. End this turn since no productive builds or trades are possible
2. Next turn, prioritize collecting brick and sheep
3. Build roads toward valuable settlement locations with brick/sheep production
4. Build a settlement at a high-value location with brick/sheep
5. Continue buying development cards when resources permit
6. Path to 10 VP: Current 4 VP + new settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + VP cards (2 VP)
</plan>

Given these considerations, the optimal move is to end my turn and preserve my resources.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game State Analysis

I'll analyze the current situation to determine my best move:

## Current Position
- **Victory Points**: 4/10 (2 cities + 1 hidden VP card)
- **Resources**: 4 Wood, 3 Wheat, 4 Ore
- **Missing Resources**: Brick, Sheep (critical for expansion)

## Strategic Assessment
My cities are at nodes 49 and 11, but I have very little road network - only 2 roads total. This severely limits my expansion capabilities. I need to expand to get more resources and victory points.

To reach 10 VP, I need 6 more points, which could come from:
- Additional settlements (1 VP each)
- Additional cities (2 VP each)
- Development cards (possible VP cards)
- Largest army (2 VP for playing 3 knights)

## Available Actions Analysis
All available actions are maritime trades:
- Actions 1, 5: Trading for sheep or brick via 2:1 ore port (I have ore access)
- Actions 2, 4, 7, 8: Trading wood 4:1 for various resources
- Actions 3, 6: Trading for wood or wheat via ports (which I already have)

## Decision Logic
Since I need to expand my road network and build new settlements, I need brick most urgently. Looking at my options:
- I can trade 2 ore for 1 brick using my ore port (Action 5)
- This is the most efficient trade available to me now

After this trade, I'll have 2 ore, 4 wood, 3 wheat, and 1 brick. This gets me closer to building roads (need wood+brick) to expand toward new settlement locations.

<plan>
1. Trade 2 ore for 1 brick using my ore port
2. Next turn, try to acquire more brick and sheep
3. Build roads toward valuable settlement locations with good resource production
4. Place new settlements to increase resource diversity
5. Continue buying development cards when possible
6. Path to 10 VP: Current 4 VP + new settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + VP cards (2 VP)
</plan>

The most effective action is to trade for brick using my ore port:

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze my current situation:

## Resources
- 4 Wood, 1 Brick, 3 Wheat, 2 Ore
- 1 Victory Point development card
- 2 Cities (4 VP total) + 1 VP card = 4/10 VP

## Opponent
- RED has 7 VP, including Longest Road (2 VP)
- I need to catch up quickly

## Critical Assessment
1. I need 6 more VP to win
2. My ore port (2:1) is valuable for the ore-wheat strategy
3. I'm not producing brick or sheep with my current buildings
4. I need to establish new settlements for resource diversification

## Strategic Options
1. Build a road to expand toward good settlement locations
2. Trade resources to get what I need for future turns
3. Save resources for a development card (costs 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore)

<plan>
1. Use my resources efficiently to build roads toward valuable settlement locations
2. Prioritize spots with sheep production (which I currently lack)
3. Continue buying development cards when possible to gain knights/VP
4. Work toward gaining largest army (2 VP)
5. Path to 10 VP: Current 4 VP + new settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + VP cards (2 VP)
</plan>

Looking at road options, I need to consider which directions give me the best expansion opportunities:

- Option 1 (edge 10, 11): Moves toward node 9 (connected to wheat 11, sheep 9, wood 4)
- Option 5 (edge 22, 49): Moves toward node 20 (connected to sheep 3, wheat 11)
- Option 7 (edge 3, 12): Moves toward nodes 2 and 4 (potential for good resource access)

Option 1 looks most promising as it would allow me to expand toward node 9, which has good resource diversity including sheep (which I currently lack). This aligns with my ore-wheat strategy while addressing my resource gaps.

I have the wood and brick needed to build this road, so I'll choose:

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Analysis of Current Game State

## Current Resources and VP Status
- I have 4 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + 1 hidden VP card
- Red has 7 VP: 1 city (2 VP) + 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP)
- My resources: 3 wood, 3 wheat, 2 ore
- I have access to a 2:1 ore port at nodes 48, 49

## Strategic Assessment
Red is 3 VP ahead of me and clearly pursuing a road-building strategy. I need to accelerate my progress toward 10 VP following the ore-wheat strategy. With 2 cities already built, I'm in a good position for resource production, but I need settlements and development cards to catch up.

## Available Actions Analysis
1. End turn - Not optimal as I have resources to use
2. Trade 2 ore for 1 brick
3. Trade 2 ore for 1 wheat
4. Trade 2 ore for 1 sheep
5. Trade 2 ore for 1 wood

Since I already have 3 wood and 3 wheat, trading for more of these doesn't make immediate sense. With only 2 ore, trading both away would leave me unable to build cities or development cards. I currently have no sheep, which I need for development cards.

## Path to Victory
Current situation:
- I have 4 VP (2 cities + 1 VP card)
- I need 6 more VP

Most efficient path:
1. Build settlements (up to 2 more VP)
2. Buy development cards for knights to get largest army (2 VP)
3. Get more VP cards (I already have 1)

<plan>
1. Since I don't have sheep, I should trade for sheep to buy development cards
2. Prioritize development cards to compete for largest army (2 VP)
3. Use remaining resources to build roads toward valuable settlement locations
4. Path to 10 VP: Current 4 VP + new settlements (2+ VP) + largest army (2 VP) + VP cards (2+ VP)
</plan>

Given my resources and the ore port I have access to, I should trade 2 ore for 1 sheep, allowing me to potentially buy a development card on a future turn when I get more wheat and ore.

# Game State Analysis

Let me carefully analyze the situation and determine the best action for this turn.

## Current Status
- **Victory Points**: 4/10 (2 cities = 4 VP + 1 hidden VP card = 5 total)
- **Resources**: 5 Wood, 1 Sheep, 3 Wheat
- **Compared to RED**: RED has 7 VP including Longest Road bonus

## Available Actions
- End turn [0]
- Trade wood for various resources via general port [1-4]

## Strategic Assessment

I currently have 5 VP (including hidden VP card) and need to reach 10 VP. My current plan focuses on development cards for largest army. Looking at my resources:
- I have 5 wood, 1 sheep, 3 wheat
- I'm missing ore entirely, which is critical for my city-focused strategy
- I don't have the right resources to buy a development card (need 1 ore, 1 wheat, 1 sheep)

Since I have cities on both nodes 49 and 11, I'm producing:
- Wheat (from node 49)
- Ore (from node 49 at probability 8)
- Wood (from node 11)

My best path is to:
1. Use my ore port at nodes 48, 49 when I get ore
2. Continue buying development cards for largest army
3. Build settlements at strategic locations for more resources

For this turn, I can't build anything significant with my current resources. I need sheep for development cards and ore for cities/development cards.

<plan>
1. Trade for sheep to buy development cards when I get ore
2. Continue focusing on development cards for largest army (2 VP)
3. Save resources for city/settlement expansion when possible
4. Path to 10 VP: Current 5 VP (including hidden) + largest army (2 VP) + development card VPs (1-2 VP) + new settlements (1-2 VP)
</plan>

Given my current resources, the most strategic move is to trade for sheep which I'm lacking and will need for development cards.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Turn 47

Let me carefully analyze my options as the Blue player following an ore-wheat strategy.

## Current Game State
- I have 4 visible VP + 1 hidden VP card = 5 VP total
- Resources: 1 Wood, 2 Sheep, 5 Wheat (but no Ore)
- Red has 7 VP (including +2 for longest road)
- I have 2 cities but no settlements
- I have access to the 2:1 Ore port at nodes 48, 49

## Resource Production Assessment
- My cities produce: Wheat(11), Ore(8), Wood(4), Wood(5)
- I lack reliable Brick and Sheep production

## Options Analysis
1. End my turn (keep resources for next turn)
2. Trade 4 Wheat for 1 Brick
3. Trade 4 Wheat for 1 Ore
4. Trade 4 Wheat for 1 Sheep
5. Trade 4 Wheat for 1 Wood

Since I already have 2 sheep, getting a 3rd sheep would allow me to buy a development card if I also get ore next turn. However, I could also use ore for settlements or additional cities.

I have 5 wheat currently. Trading 4 wheat for 1 ore would leave me with 1 wheat + 1 ore, which isn't enough for anything useful. I'd need another ore + wheat to build a city, or ore + wheat + brick + wood for a settlement.

My current plan focuses on development cards for largest army. I need ore to purchase them, and I already have sheep. Trading 4:1 for resources is inefficient, but I could get an ore to prepare for a future development card purchase.

Looking ahead, if I roll well and get ore from my city at node 49, I could then buy a development card. If not, having an ore ready would help me acquire a development card sooner.

<plan>
1. Trade for ore to prepare for development card purchases
2. Focus on getting largest army (2 VP) through knight cards
3. Save resources to expand when possible (particularly with settlements)
4. Path to 10 VP: Current 5 VP + largest army (2 VP) + development card VPs (1-2 VP) + new settlements (1-2 VP)
</plan>

After careful consideration, trading for ore seems most aligned with my strategy, as it positions me better to buy development cards in pursuit of largest army.

Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state and determine the best action for this turn.

## Game State Analysis

**My Current Status:**
- 4/10 Victory Points (2 cities = 4 VP)
- 1 hidden VP card (total = 5 VP)
- Resources: 1 Wood, 2 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore
- Need 5 more VP to win

**Opponent Status:**
- RED has 7/10 VP (visible)
- Has Longest Road bonus (+2 VP)
- Holds 8 hidden cards

**Path to Victory Analysis:**
- Current: 5 VP (including hidden VP card)
- Potential path: Get Largest Army (2 VP) + additional VP cards (1-2 VP) + settlements (1-2 VP)
- Need knights to get Largest Army (minimum 3 knights)

## Available Actions Consideration

I have two options:
1. End turn [0]
2. Buy a development card [1]

I have exactly the resources needed to buy a development card (1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore). This would leave me with 1 Wood and 1 Sheep.

## Development Card Benefits:
- Could be a Knight (helps toward Largest Army)
- Could be a Victory Point card (bringing me to 6 VP)
- Could be a Road Building, Year of Plenty, or Monopoly (all useful utility cards)

## End Turn Considerations:
- Would preserve my resources
- But would waste an opportunity to make progress

## Strategic Decision
Buying a development card aligns perfectly with my strategy to build toward Largest Army and collect VP cards. Since I have exactly the resources needed, and I'm already at 5 VP (including my hidden VP card), another VP card would bring me to 6 VP, putting me in striking distance of winning.

Additionally, if I get a Knight, I'll be one step closer to Largest Army (worth 2 VP). The utility cards would also help me gain resources or make strategic plays.

<plan>
1. Buy development cards to seek knights and VP cards
2. Focus on getting largest army (2 VP)
3. If possible, build a settlement when resources allow
4. Path to 10 VP: Current 5 VP + largest army (2 VP) + more development card VPs (1-3 VP) + new settlement (1-2 VP)
</plan>

Since this is clearly the better option to advance my strategy, I will:

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 49 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Buy development cards to seek knights and VP cards
2. Focus on getting largest army (2 VP)
3. If possible, build a settlement when resources allow
4. Path to 10 VP: Current 5 VP + largest army (2 VP) + more development card VPs (1-3 VP) + new settlement (1-2 VP)
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis for Blue Player

I'll carefully evaluate the current game state and available options:

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 4 VP: 2 cities (4 VP) + 1 hidden VP card
- RED has 7 VP: 3 settlements (3 VP) + 1 city (2 VP) + longest road (2 VP)
- I have 2 resource cards: 1 wood, 1 sheep
- I have 1 knight card and 1 victory point card
- The robber is on wood (0, -1, 1), blocking potential production

## Option Analysis
**Option 0: Play Knight Card**
- Benefits:
  - Can move the robber off our wood production and onto opponent's high-value hex
  - Can steal a resource from RED (who has 8 cards)
  - Advances toward largest army (2 VP), I'd have 1 knight played
  - Protects against discarding if a 7 is rolled (though unlikely with only 2 cards)
  - RED is close to winning at 7 VP, so hindering them is valuable

**Option 1: Roll Dice**
- Benefits:
  - Chance to get resources needed for development cards or settlements
  - If roll 8: Get ore from city at node 49
  - If roll 5: Get wood from city at node 11
  - If roll 11: Get wheat from city at node 49
  - With potential resources, could buy a development card (3 resources) or build roads

## Strategic Assessment
RED is at 7 VP and clearly in the lead. Playing the knight now would:
1. Potentially disrupt RED's production
2. Steal a resource to help our position
3. Start our path toward largest army (need 3+ knights)

My current resources (wood, sheep) alone are insufficient for meaningful building. Using the knight now maximizes its impact when RED has many cards to steal from.

<plan>
1. Play knight to disrupt RED and move toward largest army
2. Target RED's highest value hex (🌾6 hex) and steal a resource
3. Then roll for resources and continue buying development cards
4. Path to 10 VP: Current 4 VP + largest army (2 VP) + more development cards (2-3 VP) + potentially 1 more settlement (1 VP)
</plan>

The optimal move is to play the knight card to disrupt RED and begin building toward largest army.

# Strategic Analysis: Moving the Robber

I need to carefully analyze where to place the robber to maximize disruption to RED player who has 7 VP and is close to winning, while ideally gaining a useful resource.

## Step 1: Evaluate High-Value Targets
Looking at RED's settlements/cities:
- 🏙️ at node 13: Produces 🌾6, 🌲5, 🐑8 (all high probability)
- 🏠 at node 23: Produces 🐑3, ⛏️8, 🧱9
- 🏠 at node 15: Produces 🌾6, 🌾10, ⛏️4
- 🏠 at node 16: Produces 🌾10, 🐑6, 🧱10

The most valuable hexes for RED are:
- 🌾6 (-1, 0, 1): Connected to RED's city AND settlement (critical target!)
- 🐑8 (-2, 0, 2): Connected to RED's city
- ⛏️8 (2, 0, -2): Connected to RED's settlement

## Step 2: Consider Strategic Impact
Since I'm pursuing the ore-wheat strategy, the ideal play would be:
1. Block RED's highest production hex (🌾6)
2. Steal a potentially useful resource (preferably ore or wheat)
3. Avoid hurting my own production

## Step 3: Decision Making
Option [2] is clearly optimal: Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED

This targets the 🌾6 hex which:
- Has extremely high production value (⭐⭐⭐)
- Hurts RED's city production AND a settlement
- Disrupts RED's wheat production, critical for development cards and cities
- Gives me a chance to steal a resource from RED, who has 8 cards

<plan>
1. Move robber to RED's 🌾6 hex and steal a resource
2. Roll for resources and focus on buying development cards
3. Work toward largest army (need 2 more knights)
4. Path to 10 VP: Current 4 VP + largest army (2 VP) + VP cards (2-3 VP) + potentially 1 more settlement (1 VP)
</plan>

\boxed{2}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 49 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Move robber to RED's 🌾6 hex and steal a resource
2. Roll for resources and focus on buying development cards
3. Work toward largest army (need 2 more knights)
4. Path to 10 VP: Current 4 VP + largest army (2 VP) + VP cards (2-3 VP) + potentially 1 more settlement (1 VP)

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

I need to analyze the current game state and determine the most effective action based on the ore-wheat strategy.

## Current Game Status:
- I (BLUE) have 4 victory points (2 cities)
- I have 1 hidden VP card
- I've played 1 knight card already
- RED has 7 victory points including +2 for longest road
- I have 1 WOOD, 1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 2 ORE in my hand

## Path to Victory Analysis:
I need 6 more points to win. My current plan mentions getting largest army (2 VP), using VP cards (2-3 VP), and potentially building a new settlement (1 VP).

## Available Actions:
- [0] End turn
- [1] Buy development card (costs 1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE)
- [2-5] Maritime trades (not useful as I have access to 2:1 ORE port only)

## Decision Process:

1. **Development Card Analysis**:
   - Buying a development card could give me a knight (helping toward largest army), a VP card, or a useful action card
   - The cost is 1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE - which I have exactly
   - I need 2 more knights to get largest army (2 VP)
   - There could still be 3-4 VP cards in the deck

2. **End Turn Analysis**:
   - If I end my turn without using my resources, I'll have the same cards next turn
   - Not progressing toward my victory path this turn

3. **Maritime Trade Analysis**:
   - The trade options available don't help with my ore-wheat strategy or development card purchase

## Strategic Considerations:
- Development cards align perfectly with my strategy path to victory
- I have exactly the resources needed for a development card
- Drawing a knight would put me closer to largest army (need 2 more)
- Drawing a VP card would get me closer to winning
- Even action cards like Year of Plenty or Monopoly would help my strategy

<plan>
1. Buy development card this turn to pursue largest army strategy or gain another VP card
2. Continue focusing on development cards and knight play to secure largest army (2 VP)
3. Use my cities to generate ore and other resources for more development cards
4. Path to 10 VP: Current 4 VP + hidden VP card (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2-3 more VP cards/settlements
</plan>

Based on this analysis, buying a development card is clearly the optimal choice since:
- It directly advances my victory strategy
- I have exactly the resources needed
- It gives me a chance at knight cards (for largest army) or VP cards
- No other action provides progress this turn

# Game Analysis and Decision-Making

Let me analyze the current game state:

## Game Status
- RED has 9 VP (7 visible VP + 2 VP from Longest Road) and is 1 VP away from winning
- BLUE (me) has 4 visible VP + 1 hidden VP from a Victory Point card = 5 VP total
- I have 1 KNIGHT card that can be played and have already played 1 KNIGHT

## Resources
- I have 1 WOOD and 1 ORE
- RED has 4 hidden cards

## Strategic Considerations:
1. RED is on the verge of winning with 9 VP
2. The robber is currently on a wheat hex (-1, 0, 1) with a value of 6 (very productive)
3. This hex primarily affects RED's city at node 13, which produces wheat, wood, and sheep
4. RED likely needs just one more settlement or development card to win

## Action Options:
- [0] Play Knight - Move the robber and steal a resource from RED
- [1] Roll the dice

## Decision Logic:
- RED is just 1 VP from winning (9/10)
- Playing my Knight now would:
  1. Let me target RED's most productive hex and potentially disrupt their winning move
  2. Steal one of RED's 4 resources, which could be critical for their win
  3. Move me toward Largest Army (I would have 2 knights played)
- If I roll first, RED might get exactly what they need to win on their next turn
- Playing Knight before rolling gives me strategic advantage by disrupting RED

<plan>
1. Play Knight to immediately disrupt RED's resource generation
2. Place robber on RED's most valuable hex (either wheat 6 or ore 8)
3. Continue building toward Largest Army (need 1 more knight)
4. Try to build roads and settlements to block RED's expansion
5. Path to 10 VP: Current 5 VP (including hidden VP) + Largest Army (2 VP) + 3 more VP from settlements/development cards
</plan>

Given RED's imminent victory and the strategic importance of disruption, I should play my Knight card immediately.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist determined to WIN through the optimal "ore-wheat strategy". Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the MOST EFFECTIVE action to defeat the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (CRUCIAL):
- HIGHEST PRIORITY: Target the BEST ORE and WHEAT hexes with high probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
- Place settlements on intersections with MAXIMUM "PIP COUNT" (probability dots on the number tokens)
- Initial settlements should be on OPPOSITE sides of the board to maximize expansion options
- Aim for RESOURCE DIVERSITY between your two settlements (try to cover all 5 resources)
- Place on at least ONE good ORE hex and ONE good WHEAT hex between your two settlements
- Never place both settlements on the SAME RESOURCE - diversify your income!
- Initial roads should point toward valuable expansion spots or ports, NEVER toward the center
- Evaluate settlements by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placements that will be blocked or trapped by opponents
- Plan ahead to maximize the value of your FIRST TWO cities (initial settlements)

DOMINANT CITY-FOCUSED STRATEGY:
- EARLY GAME (1-5 turns): Build ONE additional settlement to secure critical resources you lack
- MID GAME (6-15 turns): UPGRADE TO CITIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE - this is your primary goal!
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're getting ore or wheat in return
- Aim for 2+ CITIES by mid-game (doubles resource production at key locations)
- ONE CITY PRODUCING DOUBLES YOUR INCOME - prioritize upgrading over new settlements
- Buy development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
- Only build roads to reach essential new settlement spots
- Be willing to trade away brick/wood/sheep to get ore/wheat for cities
- Calculate city ROI - upgrading early yields more resources over the game's duration

WINNING PATH:
1. Primary Goal: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army/longest road (2 VP) = 10 VP
2. Alternative: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. Track potential hidden VP (development cards) - hide your true score until you can win
4. Focus on quality over quantity - cities > settlements for resource production

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore (especially sheep)
- Save knights to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to get the exact resources needed to complete a city build
- Use Monopoly after high-probability rolls (target ore or wheat)
- Knights also help secure Largest Army (2 VP) - need 3+ knights played
- Keep track of VP cards drawn (max 5 in the deck)
- Save victory point cards until you can win in a single turn

EXPANSION PRIORITIES:
- Build settlements ONLY when they provide critical missing resources
- When choosing between multiple settlement locations, prioritize:
  1. High-probability production (maximum pip count)
  2. Access to resources you lack (especially ore/wheat)
  3. Strategic value (blocking opponents, access to ports)
- Build roads WITH PURPOSE - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win before committing resources
- Consider port access if you're lacking specific resources

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for cities
- If resource-starved, expand to secure that resource rather than trading at poor rates
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, consider a development card

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes that produce resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with resources you need for your next city build
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes
- Target hexes that affect multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact

TURN-BY-TURN THINKING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then settlements only for critical resources
3. Calculate the most efficient path to get required resources for city upgrades
4. If you can't build your priority item, trading or buying a development card may be better than roads
5. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 51 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Play Knight to immediately disrupt RED's resource generation
2. Place robber on RED's most valuable hex (either wheat 6 or ore 8)
3. Continue building toward Largest Army (need 1 more knight)
4. Try to build roads and settlements to block RED's expansion
5. Path to 10 VP: Current 5 VP (including hidden VP) + Largest Army (2 VP) + 3 more VP from settlements/development cards
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis - Robber Placement Decision

I need to carefully analyze the best robber placement to disrupt RED who is at 9 VP and close to winning while maximizing my own position.

## Current Game Status
- RED has 9/10 VP (1 away from winning)
- I (BLUE) have 4 VP visible + 1 hidden VP card = 5 VP
- RED has control of strong resource production
- I need to play strategically to slow RED down

## RED's Production Analysis
Let me analyze RED's most valuable hexes:
- Wheat (6) at (-1, 0, 1) ⭐⭐⭐: Very high probability, produces for RED's cities at node 13 and settlement at 15
- Sheep (8) at (-2, 0, 2) ⭐⭐⭐: High probability, produces for RED's city at node 13
- Ore (8) at (2, 0, -2) ⭐⭐⭐: High probability, produces for RED's city at node 23

## Robber Placement Evaluation
The most strategic placements to block RED:

1. **Option [10]**: Move robber to (-2, 0, 2) and steal from RED
   - This blocks RED's 8-sheep hex that feeds their city at node 13
   - High probability (⭐⭐⭐) resource

2. **Option [16]**: Move robber to (2, 0, -2) and steal from RED
   - This blocks RED's 8-ore hex that feeds their city at node 23
   - Critical ore resource (⭐⭐⭐) that RED needs to build additional cities

3. **Option [9]**: Move robber to (-1, -1, 2) and steal from RED
   - This blocks RED's 5-wood production (⭐⭐)
   - Less impactful than the other options

## Strategic Consideration
Since RED is at 9 VP and I'm executing an ore-wheat strategy:
- Blocking RED's ore production is most critical as it prevents them from building cities
- RED likely needs ore to get their final VP through city/settlement builds
- Stealing a potential ore card could also help my own city strategy

<plan>
1. Block RED's ore production to prevent them from upgrading further
2. Continue accumulating resources for knights to secure Largest Army (need 1 more)
3. Focus on building cities with my ore/wheat income when possible
4. Path to 10 VP: Current 5 VP (including hidden VP) + Largest Army (2 VP) + 3 more VP from settlements/development cards
</plan>

Given RED's proximity to winning and the ore-wheat strategy I'm pursuing, I should place the robber on RED's ore (8) hex to prevent them from getting this critical resource while potentially stealing an ore card.

\boxed{16}
