PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Initial Settlement Analysis

I need to place my first settlement optimally. This is a critical decision as it sets the foundation for my entire game strategy.

## Analyzing High-Value Nodes

Let me first identify the hexes with the strongest probability numbers (6 and 8):
- ⛏️8 (-2, 0, 2) - Ore hex with 8
- ⛏️8 (0, 2, -2) - Ore hex with 8
- 🌲6 (1, -2, 1) - Wood hex with 6
- ⛏️6 (-1, 1, 0) - Ore hex with 6

Nodes connecting to these high-probability hexes are most valuable. I'll look for nodes that:
1. Connect to multiple high-probability resources
2. Provide resource diversity
3. Have good expansion potential
4. Access to ports when possible

## Evaluating Top Candidates

Node 13: Connects to ⛏️8 (-2, 0, 2), 🌲5 (-1, -1, 2), and 🐑5 (-1, 0, 1)
- High probability ore (8)
- Resource diversity: ore, wood, sheep
- Connection to three resources
- Near 2:1 brick port
- Probability sum: 8+5+5 = 18

Node 14: Connects to ⛏️8 (-2, 0, 2), 🧱4 (-2, 1, 1), and 🐑5 (-1, 0, 1)
- High probability ore (8)
- Resource diversity: ore, brick, sheep
- Probability sum: 8+4+5 = 17

Node 17: Connects to ⛏️6 (-1, 1, 0), 🧱4 (-2, 1, 1), and 🌾2 (-2, 2, 0)
- High probability ore (6)
- Resource diversity: ore, brick, wheat
- Low wheat probability (2)
- Probability sum: 6+4+2 = 12

Node 8: Connects to 🌲6 (1, -2, 1), 🌾4 (1, -1, 0), and 🧱9 (2, -2, 0)
- High probability wood (6)
- Resource diversity: wood, wheat, brick
- Probability sum: 6+4+9 = 19

Node 19: Connects to 🌾11 (0, 1, -1), ⛏️8 (0, 2, -2), and 🌲3 (1, 1, -2)
- High probability ore (8) and decent wheat (11)
- Resource diversity: wheat, ore, wood
- Near 2:1 wood port
- Probability sum: 11+8+3 = 22

## Decision Making

Node 19 stands out with the highest probability sum (22) and connects to two high-value resources:
- Ore (8) - critical for cities
- Wheat (11) - useful for settlements and cities
- Wood (3) - helpful for expansion

This gives me access to 3 different resources including the critical ore and wheat needed for cities later in the game. The location also has reasonable expansion potential toward the wood port.

<plan>
1. Place first settlement at Node 19 for ore, wheat, and wood resources
2. For second settlement, seek a location with brick, sheep, and a resource I already have for better diversity
3. Prioritize expansion toward good ports after initial placements
4. Focus on cities as early as my resource production allows
</plan>

Given this analysis, I'll choose Node 19 for my first settlement.

\boxed{19}

# Board Analysis for Initial Road Placement

I need to carefully consider where to place my first road from my initial settlement at Node 19. This road will shape my expansion opportunities and path to victory.

## My Current Position
- I have my first settlement at Node 19, which produces:
  - 🌾 Wheat (11) - excellent high-probability number
  - ⛏️ Ore (8) - excellent high-probability number
  - 🌲 Wood (3) - low-probability number

## Analyzing Road Options
Let me evaluate each of the three possible road placements:

**[0] Road at edge (19, 20)**
- Leads toward the 🐑12 and 🌲3 hexes
- Potentially connects to 2:1 wheat port (48, 49) in the future
- Limited resource diversity for immediate expansion

**[1] Road at edge (19, 21)**
- Leads toward the 🌾11 and 🐑10 hexes
- Could eventually connect to the 2:1 ore port (40, 44) with further expansion
- Provides good diversity options moving forward

**[2] Road at edge (19, 46)**
- Leads toward the 🌲3 and 🧱10 hexes
- Could eventually connect to 2:1 wood port (45, 47)
- Provides access to brick, which I currently lack

## Strategic Considerations
1. I need to prioritize resource diversity for my second settlement
2. I already have strong wheat and ore production, so I should prioritize gaining access to brick and sheep
3. Road placement should maximize future expansion options
4. I should consider where potential settlement spots will be available after all players place their initial settlements

<plan>
1. Build first road to maximize access to brick and sheep resources I'm missing
2. Place second settlement at a node that provides brick and sheep, possibly with a 3:1 port nearby
3. Focus on balancing my production early, then transition to city upgrades
4. Strategically expand toward 2:1 ports that complement my resource production
</plan>

After analyzing the options, road option [2] leading toward node 46 appears most strategic because:
- It provides access to brick (10), which I'm currently lacking
- It offers future access to the 2:1 wood port (45, 47)
- It creates more flexibility for my expansion path
- It positions me to secure brick resources, which will be essential for early expansion

Therefore, I'll place my first road at edge (19, 46).

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 2 | Player: BLUE | Action: BUILD_INITIAL_SETTLEMENT

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build first road to maximize access to brick and sheep resources I'm missing
2. Place second settlement at a node that provides brick and sheep, possibly with a 3:1 port nearby
3. Focus on balancing my production early, then transition to city upgrades
4. Strategically expand toward 2:1 ports that complement my resource production
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.
  To adjust your plan, provide a NEW PLAN in your reasoning with <plan>your new plan</plan>

# Initial Settlement Placement Analysis

I need to choose the optimal location for my second initial settlement. This is a critical decision that will shape my entire game strategy.

First, let me assess what resources I already have from my first settlement:
- 🏠 at node 19: produces 🌾11 (wheat), ⛏️8 (ore), 🌲3 (wood)

Key considerations for second settlement:
1. Resource diversity: I need to secure brick and sheep which I'm missing
2. High probability numbers: 6, 8, 9, 5 are excellent
3. Avoiding proximity to existing settlements
4. Port access potential
5. Future expansion opportunities

## Node Analysis of Top Options

Let me examine the most promising options:

**Node 32**: Connects to 🏜️ (blocked by robber), 🌲5, and 🧱2:1 port
- Resources: Wood (5)
- Pros: 2:1 brick port, decent wood production
- Cons: Desert tile (no production), only one productive hex

**Node 4**: Connects to 🐑5, ⛏️6, 🌲3
- Resources: Sheep (5), Ore (6), Wood (3)
- Pros: Good ore on a 6, gives me sheep I'm missing, 3 productive hexes
- Cons: No brick

**Node 23**: Connects to 🌾9, 🧱10, 🐑12
- Resources: Wheat (9), Brick (10), Sheep (12)
- Pros: Gets me both brick and sheep, wheat on a good number
- Cons: 12 is a low probability

**Node 37**: Connects to ⛏️8, 🧱4, 3:1 port
- Resources: Ore (8), Brick (4) 
- Pros: Ore on excellent number, brick, general port
- Cons: Only 2 productive hexes

**Node 7**: Connects to 🌾4, 🧱9, 🌲6
- Resources: Wheat (4), Brick (9), Wood (6)
- Pros: Wood on a 6 (high value), brick on good number
- Cons: Near Red's settlement, and doesn't give me sheep

Looking at resource diversification and production probability:

Node 4 gives me sheep (missing resource) and ore on a valuable 6.
Node 23 gives me both brick and sheep (both missing), but sheep on a low-probability 12.
Node 7 has very good numbers but doesn't complete my resource set.

## Strategic Decision

I prioritize resource diversity to start, and good numbers on those resources.

Node 4 stands out as it gives me sheep (missing resource), ore on an excellent 6, and wood. The 5-6-3 combination offers strong overall probability. It also balances my production well with my existing settlement. Being on the opposite side of the board from my first settlement gives me good expansion options.

<plan>
1. Place second settlement at node 4 to secure sheep, high-probability ore, and more wood.
2. Focus on early road expansion toward brick resources or brick port.
3. Aim to build 1-2 more settlements before transitioning to city upgrades.
4. Look to secure longest road if expansion goes well, otherwise focus on development cards.

5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 2 | Player: BLUE | Action: BUILD_INITIAL_ROAD

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Place second settlement at node 4 to secure sheep, high-probability ore, and more wood.
2. Focus on early road expansion toward brick resources or brick port.
3. Aim to build 1-2 more settlements before transitioning to city upgrades.
4. Look to secure longest road if expansion goes well, otherwise focus on development cards.
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Analyzing Initial Road Placement for Blue

I need to place my second initial road to set up my expansion strategy. Let me analyze each option carefully.

## Analyzing My Current Position
- I have two settlements:
  1. Node 19: Produces wheat (11), ore (8), and wood (3)
  2. Node 3: Produces wood (3), sheep (11), and sheep (5)
- I've already placed one road at edge (19, 46)
- I need to decide where to place my second initial road from my settlement at node 3

## Evaluating Available Road Options
Let me examine each possible road placement from node 3:

**Option [0]: Road at edge (3, 4)**
- Direction: Extends toward the ore (6) hex, which is a high-value resource
- Future access: Could reach the sheep port (nodes 38, 39) with further expansion
- Leads toward a less congested area of the board

**Option [1]: Road at edge (2, 3)**
- Direction: Moves toward wheat (4) and node 2
- Future potential: Can eventually build toward node 1 (wheat, wood) but more limited options

**Option [2]: Road at edge (3, 12)**
- Direction: Extends toward the sheep (5) and wood (5) hexes
- Future access: Could lead to the brick port (nodes 32, 33)
- Allows expansion toward node 11 and potentially node 10 next to wood (6)

## Strategic Considerations
1. Resource diversity: I already produce wood, sheep, wheat, and ore but lack brick
2. Expansion potential: Need to aim toward brick production or a brick port
3. Avoiding conflict: Opponent (Red) has settlements at nodes 13 and 8

## Decision Analysis
- Option [0] gives access toward the ore hex, but I already produce ore at my node 19 settlement
- Option [1] is more limited in expansion potential
- Option [2] offers the best expansion route toward the brick port and good settlement locations near the brick (9) hex

<plan>
1. Build initial road at edge (3, 12) to move toward brick port
2. Next, expand toward node 11 and potentially node 10 (near wood 6)
3. Secure access to brick through port or expansion toward brick hexes
4. Build 1-2 more settlements before transitioning to city upgrades
5. Consider longest road strategy as I expand toward ports
</plan>

The most strategic option is to build my initial road at edge (3, 12), as it provides the best expansion potential toward the brick port and valuable future settlement locations.

RESPONSE:
# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to decide where to place the robber to maximize my advantage while hindering my opponent's progress.

## Step 1: Analyze the opponent's production
Let me look at RED player's settlements and their resource production:
- Settlement at node 13: 🐑5[⭐⭐], 🌲5[⭐⭐], ⛏️8[⭐⭐⭐]
- Settlement at node 8: 🌾4[⭐], 🧱9[⭐⭐], 🌲6[⭐⭐⭐]

RED has access to all resources with strong production on:
- Ore 8 (highest probability)
- Wood 6 (high probability)
- Wood 5 (medium probability)
- Brick 9 (medium probability)

## Step 2: Evaluate robber placement options that allow stealing
I should prioritize hexes where:
1. RED has settlements but I don't
2. The hex has high production value (8, 6, 5)
3. Resource types that are valuable for RED's likely next builds

Looking at the options that allow me to steal from RED:
- [1] (1, -1, 0) - Wheat 4 hex - low priority
- [3] (-1, 0, 1) - Sheep 5 hex - moderate priority
- [7] (2, -2, 0) - Brick 9 hex - moderate priority
- [8] (1, -2, 1) - Wood 6 hex - high priority
- [9] (-1, -1, 2) - Wood 5 hex - moderate priority
- [10] (-2, 0, 2) - Ore 8 hex - highest priority

## Step 3: Decision reasoning
The Ore 8 hex (option 10) is the most impactful target because:
1. It's a high probability hex (8)
2. Ore is extremely valuable for city upgrades
3. RED has a settlement there but I don't
4. This would significantly slow RED's ability to upgrade to cities early

Wood 6 hex (option 8) would be my second choice since it's a high probability resource, but ore is more critical to control at this stage.

<plan>
1. Place robber on ore 8 to slow RED's city development
2. Continue expanding toward brick port with next road builds
3. Aim to build next settlement at node 11 or 32
4. Look for opportunities to secure better ore access
5. Maintain flexible development path toward either longest road or balanced growth
</plan>

\boxed{10}

You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 6 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Place robber on ore 8 to slow RED's city development
2. Continue expanding toward brick port with next road builds
3. Aim to build next settlement at node 11 or 32
4. Look for opportunities to secure better ore access
5. Maintain flexible development path toward either longest road or balanced growth
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.
  To adjust your plan, provide a NEW PLAN in your reasoning with <plan>your new plan</plan>

# Board Analysis

First, let's assess our current situation:
- We have 2 Victory Points (2 settlements)
- Resources: 1 🌲WOOD, 4 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT
- Red is ahead with 3 VP (3 settlements)
- The robber is currently on ⛏️8 hex, which hurts both RED and BLUE (our settlement at node 19)
- Our settlements produce: 🌾11, ⛏️8, 🌲3, 🐑11, 🐑5
- Our current plan is to expand toward the brick port and build at node 11 or 32

# Resource Analysis

Looking at our resources (1 wood, 4 sheep, 1 wheat), we cannot:
- Build a road (need 1 wood + 1 brick)
- Build a settlement (need 1 wood + 1 brick + 1 sheep + 1 wheat)
- Build a city (need 3 ore + 2 wheat)
- Buy a development card (need 1 ore + 1 sheep + 1 wheat)

# Action Options
1. End turn (Option 0)
2. Trade 4 sheep for some other resource (Options 1-4)

If we trade 4 sheep, we could get:
- Wood (would give us 2 wood total)
- Wheat (would give us 2 wheat total)
- Brick (would give us 1 brick total)
- Ore (would give us 1 ore total)

# Strategic Evaluation

Looking at possible trades:
- Trading for wood: We already have 1 wood, so getting another doesn't enable any builds yet
- Trading for wheat: Getting another wheat doesn't enable any immediate builds
- Trading for brick: With 1 brick + our 1 wood, we could build a road next turn toward our expansion goal
- Trading for ore: We need 3 ore for a city, so 1 ore doesn't help immediately

According to our plan, we want to expand toward the brick port and our next settlement at node 11 or 32. Building a road next turn would advance this goal, and for that we need brick.

<plan>
1. Trade 4 sheep for 1 brick this turn
2. Next turn, use wood + brick to build road toward node 11/32
3. Continue expanding toward brick port
4. Aim for settlement at node 11 or 32 for better resource diversity
5. Once established, focus on city upgrades with improved ore access
</plan>

The most strategic action is to trade for a brick, which aligns with our expansion plan.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and my available options:

## Current Position
- I have 2 victory points (2 settlements)
- I have 1 wood, 1 brick, and 1 wheat
- Red has 3 victory points (3 settlements) and is ahead of me
- The robber is on a ore-8 hex, blocking a high-value resource

## Resource Situation
- I have access to wheat (11, 3), wood (3), ore (8), and sheep (11, 5)
- I'm lacking consistent brick production, which is limiting my expansion
- My current settlements are at nodes 19 and 3

## Available Actions
I can either end my turn or build a road in one of 8 possible locations. Since I have exactly 1 wood and 1 brick, I can build 1 road this turn.

## Strategic Road Options Analysis

1. Road at (45, 46): This would extend from my settlement at node 19 toward the wood port. It gives expansion options and potentially access to the wood port which complements my strategy.

2. Road at (3, 4): This extends from my settlement at node 3 toward the ore hex and potentially toward the sheep port.

3. Road at (19, 20): Extends toward the sheep hex and wheat hex, giving me more expansion options from my settlement at 19.

4. Road at (12, 13): This connects toward node 13 where Red already has a settlement, so this isn't valuable.

5. Road at (2, 3): This doesn't open any new expansion opportunities as it points backward from my settlement.

6. Road at (11, 12): Extends from my road at node 12 toward better expansion options including the brick port at nodes 32/33.

7. Road at (46, 48): Extends toward the wheat port from node 46.

8. Road at (19, 21): Extends toward ore-8 and wheat-11 hexes from my settlement at 19.

## Strategic Decision

My current plan mentioned expanding toward node 11/32 to reach the brick port. This would provide access to brick without needing direct production. Given my current resource limitations, this remains a good strategy.

Looking at the options, road at (11, 12) aligns with this plan as it continues expansion toward the brick port. However, I notice that I don't actually have a road at node 12 yet, so this isn't a valid expansion.

Instead, building a road at (3, 4) creates a path toward the ore hex and sheep port while giving me expansion options toward nodes 15/16, which could connect to valuable resources.

Road at (19, 20) is also strong as it expands toward nodes with wheat-11 and sheep-12, giving me good expansion options.

Looking again at my original plan, expanding toward node 11/32 would mean building from node 3 toward node 12 first, so option 2 (road at (3, 4)) doesn't align with this path.

<plan>
1. Build road at edge (12, 11) to expand toward brick port
2. Continue expanding toward node 11/32 to secure the brick port
3. Build settlement at node 11 or 32 for better resource diversity
4. Once established, focus on city upgrades with improved ore access
</plan>

I need to revise my plan since I can't build directly at (12, 11) yet. The best path would be:

<plan>
1. Build road at edge (3, 12) to begin expansion toward brick port
2. Next turn, build road from node 12 to node 11
3. Continue expanding toward node 32 to secure the brick port
4. Build settlement at node 32 for better resource access
5. Once established, focus on city upgrades with improved ore access
</plan>

Wait, I already have a road at (3, 12) as shown in my roads list. So I need to build from node 12 to node 11, which would be option 6.

Let me verify this is valid: I have roads at (3, 12) and (12, 3), so building at (11, 12) would extend my network appropriately toward the brick port.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Analyzing Robber Placement Options

Let me analyze the game state and determine the optimal robber placement:

## Current Game State
- I'm Blue with 2 VP (2 settlements)
- Red has 3 VP (3 settlements), leading by 1 VP
- Red has more developed road network (longest: 3) vs my longest of 2
- I have 1 wheat resource, Red has 2 hidden resources
- The robber is currently on (-2, 0, 2), which is an ore hex with productivity 8

## Strategic Considerations for Robber Placement:
1. Disrupt Red's resource production, particularly high-value hexes
2. Target hexes that Red benefits from but I don't
3. Potentially steal a useful resource
4. Protect my own future expansion plans
5. Consider blocking resources that Red needs for their next likely builds

## Analyzing Red's Settlements:
- Red at node 13: produces from 🐑5, 🌲5, ⛏️8 (currently blocked)
- Red at node 8: produces from 🌾4, 🧱9, 🌲6
- Red at node 6: produces from 🌾4, 🐑12, 🌾9

Looking at the high-value hexes (those with 6 and 8):
- 🌲6 at (1, -2, 1) - benefits Red's settlement at node 8
- ⛏️8 at (-2, 0, 2) - currently blocked by robber (benefits Red at node 13)
- ⛏️8 at (0, 2, -2) - no settlements currently
- 🌾11 at (0, 1, -1) - benefits my settlement at node 19

## Best Robber Placement Options:

1. **Option [8]** - Move to (1, -2, 1) and steal from RED
   - This blocks wood 6, a very productive hex that benefits Red but not me
   - Removes a key resource (wood) that Red needs for expansion

2. **Option [1]** - Move to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED
   - This blocks wheat 4 which benefits two of Red's settlements (nodes 6 and 8)
   - Disrupts Red's wheat production which is needed for cities/development cards

3. **Option [7]** - Move to (2, -2, 0) and steal from RED
   - This blocks brick 9, which benefits Red's settlement at node 8
   - Brick is valuable for early expansion

4. **Option [17]** - Move to (2, -1, -1) and steal from RED
   - This blocks wheat 9, which benefits Red's settlement at node 6
   - Would disrupt Red's wheat production

Looking at my current plan to expand toward the brick port, option [7] to block brick production would help slow down Red's expansion while potentially giving me a brick resource via stealing, which aligns with my expansion plan.

However, option [8] targets the most productive hex that Red controls (wood 6), which is critical for Red's expansion and would hurt them the most. While brick is important for me too, preventing Red from getting wood is more disruptive to their strategy right now.

<plan>
1. Block Red's key resources to slow their expansion
2. Build road at edge (12, 11) to expand toward brick port
3. Continue expanding toward node 11/32 to secure the brick port
4. Build settlement at node 11 or 32 for better resource diversity
5. Once established, focus on city upgrades with improved ore access
</plan>

My optimal choice is to move the robber to the wood 6 hex to disrupt Red's most productive resource spot and potentially steal a useful resource.

# Game Analysis for Turn 10

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 2 victory points (2 settlements)
- Red has 3 victory points (3 settlements)
- Resources: 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore
- Red is ahead in both settlements (3 vs 2) and roads (4 vs 3)
- My settlements produce wheat (11), ore (8), wood (3), and sheep (5, 11)
- The robber is currently on the wood hex (6) blocking a key Red resource

## Available Actions
I only have two options:
1. Buy a development card (costs 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore)
2. End my turn

## Action Analysis

### Option 1: Buy a Development Card
**Pros:**
- Could get a Victory Point card (immediate hidden progress)
- Could get a Knight to help establish Largest Army (2 VP)
- Could get useful action cards (Road Building, Year of Plenty, Monopoly)
- Using all resources means I won't lose anything to a 7 roll
- Red only has 2 hidden cards, so risk of losing to robber is low

**Cons:**
- Development cards are a gamble - could get a Knight that I can't use immediately
- Will use all my current resources, leaving me with nothing for next turn

### Option 2: End Turn
**Pros:**
- Save resources for future build opportunities
- Might collect more resources next round for a more strategic build

**Cons:**
- Not making progress this turn
- Risk losing resources if a 7 is rolled
- Red continues to pull ahead if they can build next turn

## Strategic Considerations
- I'm behind Red who already has 3 settlements vs my 2
- My current plan focuses on expanding toward the brick port, but I need more resources
- Development cards can provide hidden VP or Knights for largest army path to victory
- With only 3 resources, I can't build anything else this turn (road costs 2, settlement costs 4)

<plan>
1. Buy development card now to potentially secure VP or Knight
2. Continue focusing on getting resources to build road at edge (12, 11)
3. Expand toward node 11/32 to secure the brick port
4. Build settlement at node 11 or 32 for better resource diversity
5. Once established, focus on city upgrades with my good ore access
</plan>

Since I can't make any direct builds and I'm already falling behind Red, buying a development card is the optimal move. This gives me a chance at a VP card or Knight while using resources that might otherwise be lost to a robber roll.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 12 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Buy development card now to potentially secure VP or Knight
2. Continue focusing on getting resources to build road at edge (12, 11)
3. Expand toward node 11/32 to secure the brick port
4. Build settlement at node 11 or 32 for better resource diversity
5. Once established, focus on city upgrades with my good ore access
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis: Turn 12

I need to decide between using my Road Building card now or rolling the dice. Let's analyze the game state and options carefully.

## Current Situation Assessment:
- I have 2 VP (2 settlements)
- I have 1 sheep and 1 wheat in hand, plus a Road Building development card
- Red player is ahead with 3 VP (3 settlements) and longer roads (3 vs my 2)
- The robber is on a wood hex (1,-2,1) with a valuable 6 roll

## Option 0: Play Road Building Card
If I play the Road Building card now:
- Advantages:
  * I could build two free roads to advance toward the brick port (nodes 32-33)
  * This would potentially set me up for a settlement at node 11 or 32
  * I wouldn't need to wait for wood/brick resources
- Disadvantages:
  * I currently have only 1 sheep + 1 wheat, which isn't enough to immediately follow up with a settlement (need brick)
  * The card might be more valuable later when I'm resource-constrained

## Option 1: Roll the Dice
If I roll now:
- I will potentially gain more resources to either:
  * Buy a development card (need ore + sheep + wheat)
  * Build a road (need wood + brick)
  * Save toward a settlement (need wood + brick + sheep + wheat)
- My settlements produce on:
  * Settlement 1: Wheat 11★, Ore 8★★★, Wood 3★
  * Settlement 2: Wood 3★, Sheep 11★, Sheep 5★★
- A good roll could give me resources to make immediate progress

## Strategic Considerations:
- I'm behind in VP (2 vs 3) and need to catch up
- My Road Building card is valuable but would be most effective if I could follow up with a settlement
- I have good ore production (8) which is excellent for development cards and city upgrades
- Rolling first gives me a chance to get more resources before deciding my next move

<plan>
1. Roll dice to collect more resources
2. If I get wood/brick, build a road toward the brick port (nodes 11-32)
3. If I get ore/wheat/sheep, buy a development card
4. Use Road Building card when I have (or am very close to having) enough resources for a settlement
5. Focus next on settlement at node 11 or 32 to secure the brick port
6. Once established with good resource diversity, prioritize city upgrades leveraging my ore production
</plan>

I think rolling first makes the most sense. I don't have enough resources to build a settlement after playing Road Building, and rolling could give me the resources I need for immediate progress.

❓ Select action by number (0-17):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the robber placement options to determine the best strategic move for my BLUE player.

First, I need to assess my current position and goals:
- I have 2 Victory Points from my two settlements.
- I have limited resources (1 sheep, 1 wheat).
- I have a Road Building card that I plan to use for expansion.
- RED is ahead with 3 Victory Points and has more settlements.
- My plan involves building toward the brick port (nodes 11-32).

When deciding where to place the robber, I should consider:
1. Blocking high-probability hexes that RED relies on
2. Targeting hexes that produce resources I need
3. Ensuring I can steal a resource from RED when possible

Looking at RED's settlements:
- Node 13: Produces sheep(5), wood(5), ore(8) - this is a strong production spot with ore(8) being a high-value hex
- Node 8: Produces wheat(4), brick(9), wood(6) - wood(6) is a high-probability resource
- Node 6: Produces wheat(4), sheep(12), wheat(9) - multiple wheat sources

The most impactful options are:

Option [10] - Move robber to (-2, 0, 2) [ore 8] and steal from RED:
- This blocks a high-probability ore(8) hex
- RED's settlement at node 13 produces from this hex
- Ore is valuable for city upgrades
- I can steal a resource from RED

Option [9] - Move robber to (-1, -1, 2) [wood 5] and steal from RED:
- Blocks wood(5) production for RED at node 13
- Wood will be useful for my road building strategy
- I can steal from RED

Option [7] - Move robber to (2, -2, 0) [brick 9] and steal from RED:
- Blocks brick(9) production for RED at node 8
- Brick would help me with my road-building plan
- I can steal from RED

Given my plan to build roads toward the brick port, the most strategic move is to block RED's brick production and potentially steal a brick for myself. This directly supports my expansion plans.

<plan>
1. Place robber on the brick hex to block RED's brick production and attempt to steal brick
2. Use Road Building card to expand toward brick port (nodes 11-32)
3. Build settlement at node 11 or 32 to secure the brick port
4. Later focus on city upgrades leveraging my ore production at node 19
</plan>

Therefore, I choose option [7] to move the robber to the brick(9) hex at (2, -2, 0) and steal from RED.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Turn 12

Let me analyze the current game state and my available options:

## Current Situation
- I have 2 VP from my 2 settlements
- RED has 3 VP from 3 settlements and is leading
- The robber is already on RED's brick hex (2,-2,0)
- I have limited resources: 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore
- I have a Road Building development card

## Available Actions:
0. Play Road Building card - Build two roads for free
1. End my turn
2. Buy a development card (costs my 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore)

## Action Analysis:

### Option 0: Play Road Building
- This would allow me to extend my road network for free
- Looking at my current roads (19-46, 3-12, 11-12), I can expand toward:
  - From node 19: I could build toward node 21/43 to approach the ore port
  - From node 11: I could build toward node 32 to reach the brick port
  - From node 46: I could build toward node 45/48 to reach the wood or wheat port
- Expanding from node 11 toward the brick port seems most strategic, as it would give me access to the brick resource I'm missing

### Option 1: End Turn
- This would waste my turn and not improve my position

### Option 2: Buy Development Card
- Would use all my current resources
- Potential benefits:
  - Could get Victory Point card (25% chance)
  - Could get Knight to move robber and steal from RED
  - Could get other utility cards
- Risks: May get a card that doesn't help immediately

## Strategic Evaluation:
- The Road Building card provides guaranteed and immediate value
- Using Road Building now allows me to position for future settlement placement
- By expanding toward the brick port, I can partially compensate for my lack of brick production
- A development card is a gamble - might get VP but could also get something less useful
- My current plan of heading toward the brick port still makes sense

<plan>
1. Use Road Building card to extend from node 11 toward the brick port (nodes 11-32 and 32-33)
2. Focus on getting resources to build a settlement at node 32 to secure the brick port
3. Continue developing my ore/wheat production for city upgrades
4. Consider settlement at node 46 to increase ore production
</plan>

Based on this analysis, the clear best option is to play the Road Building card now to advance toward the brick port and set up my next settlement.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the board and my current position to determine the best action.

## Current Status
- I have 2 settlements (2 VP) and need 8 more VP to win
- I have 1 sheep, 1 wheat, and 1 ore, but no wood or brick to build roads normally
- I've already played a Road Building card, which allows me to build 2 roads without requiring resources
- My current settlements are at nodes 19 and 3, producing wheat, ore, wood, and sheep

## Reviewing My Current Plan
My original plan was to use Road Building to extend from node 11 toward the brick port (nodes 11-32 and 32-33). However, I notice that:
1. I don't currently have a road at node 11, making this strategy impossible
2. My actual roads are at (19, 46), (3, 12), and (11, 12)
3. There seems to be an inconsistency in the road listing

## Available Road Building Options
Looking at the available actions, I need to determine which roads would be most strategic for expansion:

1. The brick port (nodes 32-33) would be valuable since I don't currently produce brick
2. Expanding from node 46 could potentially lead to more ore production at node 48 (connected to the ore hex)
3. Expanding toward uncontested resource-rich areas is a priority

## Best Strategic Moves

Since I've already played the Road Building card, I need to choose which road to build with the development card benefit (no resources required). Looking at the board:

- Option [4] Build road at (11, 32) moves me toward the brick port, which aligns with my plan
- Option [7] Build road at (46, 48) expands toward potential ore production and the wheat port

<plan>
1. Build road at edge (11, 32) to advance toward the brick port
2. Build my second Road Building road at edge (32, 33) to secure access to the brick port
3. Work toward getting resources for a settlement at node 32 to utilize the brick port
4. Continue developing ore/wheat production for city upgrades
5. Consider settlement at node 46 to increase ore production
</plan>

Looking at the options, building road [4] (11, 32) is the best choice as it advances me toward the brick port, which I need since I don't currently produce brick. This follows my original plan and positions me for future expansion.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

RESPONSE:
# Game Analysis for Turn 12

Let me carefully analyze the current state of the game and my available options to determine the optimal move.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 2 VP (2 settlements)
- Red has 3 VP (3 settlements)
- I currently lack brick in my hand (have 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore)
- I already used my Road Building development card last turn to build roads at (19, 46) and (11, 32)

## My Current Production
- Settlement at node 19: wheat(11), ore(8), wood(3)
- Settlement at node 3: wood(3), sheep(11), sheep(5)
- Key observation: I have decent ore and wheat production (needed for development cards and cities)

## My Current Plan Review
My plan involves extending toward the brick port at node 32/33, which would be valuable since I'm not currently producing brick. Let me review the available road building options to see which best advances my strategy.

## Road Building Options Analysis
Looking at the available actions, I need to build roads that directly advance my strategic goals:

1. Building at (32, 33) directly follows my plan to secure the brick port
2. Building at (46, 48) extends toward the wheat port and enables future settlement at node 48
3. Building at (45, 46) creates more connectivity around my settlement at node 19
4. Building at (19, 20) opens up expansion toward resource diversity
5. The other options don't clearly advance my position

## Decision Reasoning
Since I already used my Road Building card last turn to build roads at (19, 46) and (11, 32), I should continue with my plan. Building the road at edge (32, 33) directly follows my plan to secure the brick port, which will alleviate my brick shortage.

From my settlement at node 3, securing the brick port will give me access to all resources either through production or efficient trading. This aligns with my balanced growth strategy.

Additionally, extending to the brick port at (32, 33) positions me to build a settlement at node 33 in the future, which would give me access to the brick port and two resource hexes.

<plan>
1. Build road at edge (32, 33) to secure access to the brick port
2. Work toward getting resources for a settlement at node 33 to utilize the brick port
3. Continue developing ore/wheat production for city upgrades 
4. Consider future settlement at node 48 (near wheat port) or node 20
5. Monitor Red's expansion and be ready to block if necessary
</plan>

Therefore, I choose to build a road at edge (32, 33).

# Game Analysis for Turn 12

Let me analyze the current state of the game and evaluate my options:

## Current Game State
- I have 2 victory points (2 settlements)
- I currently have 1 sheep, 1 wheat, and 1 ore resource
- Red has 3 victory points (3 settlements) and is ahead
- The robber is on the brick hex (2, -2, 0)
- I have 10 roads built already (with longest continuous road of 4)

## Available Actions
I only have two options:
[0] End my turn
[1] Buy a development card (costs 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore)

## Resource Analysis
I have exactly the resources needed to buy a development card. If I don't use them, I risk losing resources to the robber if I roll a 7 on my next turn.

## Development Card Benefits
- Could be a Victory Point card (immediate +1 VP, kept secret)
- Could be a Knight (allows moving robber, counts toward Largest Army)
- Could be Year of Plenty (2 resources of my choice)
- Could be Monopoly (take all of one resource type from opponents)
- Could be Road Building (place 2 roads for free)

## Strategic Considerations
1. I'm behind Red in victory points (2 vs 3)
2. Getting a development card could help me catch up, especially if it's a VP card
3. A knight would allow me to move the robber away from important resources and potentially get resources from Red
4. Development cards are a good use of ore, which I need mainly for cities but don't have enough to build one yet
5. If I save resources, I risk losing them to the robber
6. I'm still following my plan to secure access to the brick port, which might require resources in future turns

<plan>
1. Buy a development card now to use resources efficiently
2. Continue working toward building road at edge (32, 33) to secure brick port access
3. Focus on getting resources for a settlement at node 33 to utilize the brick port
4. Continue developing ore/wheat production for city upgrades
5. Consider development card strategy as an alternative path to victory if I get valuable cards
</plan>

Given my current situation, buying a development card is the optimal move. It uses my resources efficiently, prevents potential losses to the robber, and could provide a valuable advantage through a VP card, knight, or special ability.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 14 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Buy a development card now to use resources efficiently
2. Continue working toward building road at edge (32, 33) to secure brick port access
3. Focus on getting resources for a settlement at node 33 to utilize the brick port
4. Continue developing ore/wheat production for city upgrades
5. Consider development card strategy as an alternative path to victory if I get valuable cards
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

RESPONSE:
# Game Analysis for Turn 14

Let me analyze the current game state and my available options for this turn.

## Current Status
- I have 2/10 victory points (2 settlements)
- Red has 3/10 victory points (3 settlements)
- I have no resources in hand
- I have 1 KNIGHT development card
- The robber is currently on a brick hex (2, -2, 0) with probability 9

## Available Actions
[0] Play Knight card - Move the robber and steal a resource
[1] Roll the dice

## Strategic Considerations

1) **Playing Knight Card**:
   - Advantages:
     - Move robber from brick hex (could potentially help production)
     - Steal a resource from Red (who has 2 cards)
     - Start building toward largest army (need 3 knights total)
   - Disadvantages:
     - I have no resources to build with after playing the knight
     - Knight card could be more valuable later when I need specific resources

2) **Rolling Dice**:
   - Advantages:
     - Could gain resources to continue with building plan
     - My settlements produce on good numbers (8, 11, 3, 5)
   - Disadvantages:
     - Risk of rolling 7 and activating robber when I have no resources (no downside here)

## Production Analysis
My settlements produce:
- Settlement 1: Wheat(11), Ore(8), Wood(3)
- Settlement 2: Wood(3), Sheep(11), Sheep(5)

If I roll well, I could get resources needed for my building plan.

## Plan Evaluation
My current plan focuses on:
- Buying development cards
- Building toward the brick port
- Improving ore/wheat production

Given I have no resources right now, rolling has a higher expected value than playing the knight card. The knight card will be more valuable when:
1. I'm holding 7+ cards and want to avoid losing resources
2. I need to move a robber from my high-producing hex
3. I need a specific resource that Red has

<plan>
1. Roll for resources now
2. If I receive enough resources, consider buying another development card
3. Continue working toward the brick port via node 33
4. Focus on upgrading to cities when I have sufficient ore and wheat
5. Keep the knight card for emergency situations or to build toward largest army
</plan>

Since I have no resources, playing the knight doesn't advance my position significantly. Rolling gives me the chance to collect resources and make progress on my building plan.

# Game Analysis for Turn 14

I need to analyze my current position and determine the optimal action between playing my Knight card or ending my turn.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 2 VP (2 settlements)
- Red has 3 VP (3 settlements)
- I have no resources in hand
- I have 1 Knight development card
- The robber is on brick (2,-2,0), which doesn't affect my production
- I've already rolled for resources this turn, but didn't receive any

## Knight Card Analysis
If I play the Knight card now:
1. I'd move the robber to a productive hex for Red
2. I could steal one random resource from Red
3. I'd have 1 knight played toward Largest Army (need 3)

However, since I've already rolled this turn and received no resources, playing the Knight now doesn't protect any income. Also, having just one random resource from Red likely won't enable any builds this turn.

## Strategic Considerations
- Saving the Knight for a future turn has more value - I can use it to protect high-value hexes when I have resources at risk
- Playing development cards without a clear immediate benefit is inefficient
- The Knight could be more valuable later when:
  - I need to move the robber from a valuable hex
  - I'm close to collecting the other 2 knights needed for Largest Army
  - I have 7+ cards and anticipate a robber roll
  
<plan>
1. Save resources to build toward the brick port at node 33
2. Focus on upgrading settlements to cities when I accumulate ore and wheat
3. Hold the Knight card for protection or future Largest Army opportunities
4. Look to expand with another settlement when resources permit
5. Consider buying another development card if excess ore/wheat/sheep accumulate
</plan>

Given that playing the Knight card now offers minimal strategic value, and I should save it for a more impactful moment, the optimal action is to end my turn.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze my current game state:

- I have 2 victory points (2 settlements)
- I only possess 1 ore resource currently
- I have 1 knight development card (unplayed)
- The opponent has 3 victory points (3 settlements)
- The robber is currently on a brick hex (2, -2, 0) with roll number 9

## Decision Options

I have two options:
1. Play my knight development card now
2. Roll the dice and continue normally

Let's evaluate each option:

### Option 0: Play Knight Card
Advantages:
- Move the robber from its current location (brick hex)
- Steal a resource from RED (who has 4 resources)
- Start building toward largest army (need 3 knights total)
- Protect against losing resources if I roll a 7 (though with only 1 card, this is not a concern)

Disadvantages:
- Knight cards are valuable strategic assets that could be more useful later
- I only have 1 resource (ore) currently, so playing the knight now doesn't create immediate building opportunities

### Option 1: Roll the Dice
Advantages:
- Chance to collect more resources to enable building
- Save the knight card for when I have more than 7 resources or when I really need a specific resource
- Natural progression of the game

Disadvantages:
- Risk rolling a 7, which would activate the robber (though with only 1 card, I wouldn't lose anything)

## Strategic Analysis

Looking at my position:
- I need to accumulate more resources to advance my strategy
- I currently have very few resources (just 1 ore)
- The knight card provides more value if I save it for when I actually need it

My settlements produce on 3, 5, 8, and 11, which gives me decent resource diversity but I need to collect more to build toward the brick port as per my plan.

<plan>
1. Continue saving resources to build toward the brick port at node 33
2. Focus on upgrading settlements to cities when I accumulate ore and wheat
3. Hold the Knight card for protection or future Largest Army opportunities
4. Look to expand with another settlement when resources permit
5. Consider buying another development card if excess ore/wheat/sheep accumulate
</plan>

## Decision

Given my current limited resources (only 1 ore), playing the knight now would not enable any immediate builds. It's more valuable to roll the dice and potentially collect more resources first. The knight card should be saved for when I have more than 7 resources or when I strategically need to move the robber from a high-value hex.

# Game State Analysis

Let me carefully analyze the current game state to make the optimal decision:

## Current Resources
I have:
- 2 Wood
- 1 Ore
- 1 Knight development card

## Victory Point Status
- BLUE (me): 2 VP from 2 settlements
- RED: 3 VP from 3 settlements
- RED is ahead by 1 point

## Board Position Analysis
- I have settlements at nodes 19 and 3
- The robber is currently on the brick hex (2, -2, 0) with value 9
- This isn't blocking any of my production

## Available Actions
0. Play Knight card - Move the robber and steal a resource
1. End my turn

## Strategic Considerations

With my current resources (2 Wood, 1 Ore), I cannot build anything:
- Road = 1 Wood + 1 Brick (missing brick)
- Settlement = 1 Wood + 1 Brick + 1 Sheep + 1 Wheat (missing multiple resources)
- City = 2 Wheat + 3 Ore (missing wheat and more ore)
- Development Card = 1 Wheat + 1 Sheep + 1 Ore (missing wheat and sheep)

The Knight card would let me:
1. Move the robber from the brick hex to another hex
2. Steal a random resource from RED

Looking at RED's production:
- They have strong brick and wood production
- They have 4 hidden resources

<plan>
1. Continue saving resources to build toward the brick port at node 33
2. Focus on upgrading settlements to cities when I accumulate ore and wheat
3. Use the Knight card strategically to disrupt RED's production on high-probability hexes
4. Look to expand with another settlement when resources permit
5. Consider buying another development card if excess ore/wheat/sheep accumulate
</plan>

## Decision

Playing the Knight card now would:
- Let me move the robber to disrupt RED's strong production (possibly the wood 6 or ore 8)
- Let me steal a resource from RED, possibly getting a resource I need
- Progress toward Largest Army (currently 0-0)

However:
- Holding the Knight for defense might be more valuable if I accumulate resources
- RED only has 4 cards now, so the theft impact is limited
- RED is only 1 VP ahead, not an immediate threat to win

I should hold onto my Knight card for now. It will be more valuable when:
1. I need to protect my own resources from the robber
2. RED accumulates more resources worth stealing
3. I'm closer to making a build and need a specific resource

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

4. Look to expand with another settlement when resources permit
5. Consider buying another development card if excess ore/wheat/sheep accumulate

❓ Select action by number (0-1):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state and make the optimal decision for the BLUE player.

First, let's assess our current position:
- We have 2 victory points from our 2 settlements
- We have 2 wood and 1 ore as resources
- We have 1 Knight development card
- The robber is on brick (2,-2,0), which is affecting RED's settlement at node 8

Key considerations:
1. Resources: We only have 2 wood and 1 ore, which isn't enough to build anything (settlement = 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat, 1 sheep; city = 3 ore, 2 wheat; development card = 1 ore, 1 wheat, 1 sheep)
2. Knight card: Playing it would move the robber and steal a resource from an opponent
3. Rolling: Would generate more resources based on the dice outcome

The robber is currently on a hex that affects RED's settlement, which is good for us. RED is ahead with 3 VP vs our 2 VP.

If we play the Knight card:
- We could move the robber to another hex that affects RED (e.g., the wheat 4 hex that feeds two of RED's settlements)
- We'd steal one resource from RED
- We'd start building toward Largest Army (need 3 knights total)
- We'd protect ourselves from potential resource loss if a 7 is rolled

If we roll the dice:
- We could gain more resources based on our settlements
- There's a risk of rolling a 7, which would force us to discard half our cards if we have more than 7 (not currently an issue)
- We'd save our Knight for a more strategic moment or when more knights are available

Since we only have 3 resources, playing the Knight doesn't significantly strengthen our immediate building position. We'd be better off rolling to collect more resources since we're still below the 7-card threshold. Also, we should save our Knight cards for potentially protecting our high-production hexes later or for making a push for Largest Army when we're closer to having 3 knights.

<plan>
1. Focus on rolling for more resources first
2. Save Knight card for when we need to protect high-value hexes or when we're closer to obtaining Largest Army
3. Continue working toward our brick port at node 33 when we have sufficient resources
4. Look to upgrade settlements to cities when ore and wheat accumulate
</plan>

Therefore, I choose to roll the dice.

# Game Analysis for Turn 18

I'll analyze our current position and available options to make the best strategic decision.

## Current Game State Assessment:
- We (BLUE) have 2 VP from 2 settlements
- RED has 3 VP from 3 settlements
- We have limited resources: 2 wood, 1 ore
- We have 1 KNIGHT development card
- The robber is currently on brick hex (2, -2, 0) with value 9

## Option Analysis:

**Option 0: Play Knight Card**
- Benefits:
  - Move the robber from its current position (brick hex)
  - Potentially steal a useful resource from RED
  - Make progress toward Largest Army (2 VP)
  - Protect our high-value hexes if needed

**Option 1: End Turn**
- Benefits:
  - Save Knight card for a more strategic moment
  - Continue with our current plan

## Strategic Considerations:

1. **Resource Situation**: With only 3 resources (2 wood, 1 ore), we can't build anything this turn.

2. **Robber Impact**: The robber is currently on a brick hex that primarily affects RED (node 8). Moving it doesn't directly benefit our resource production.

3. **Knight Card Value**: Knights are most valuable when:
   - Protecting our high-value hexes from the robber
   - Moving the robber to disrupt opponent's key resources
   - Working toward Largest Army (need 3+ knights)

4. **Opponent's Position**: RED is ahead with 3 VP vs our 2 VP, but not by a significant margin.

5. **Future Planning**: We should save resources and useful development cards for more impactful moments.

Since we can't build anything now and the robber isn't directly hurting us, playing the Knight card would be premature. We should save it for when:
- We need to protect our 8-ore hex
- We're closer to obtaining Largest Army
- We can specifically target a resource we need

<plan>
1. Save Knight card for a more strategic moment when we can protect our 8-ore hex or when closer to Largest Army
2. Continue working toward our brick port at node 33 when we accumulate sufficient resources
3. Look to upgrade settlements to cities when we gather more ore and wheat
4. Focus on rolling for resources and make strategic builds next turn
</plan>

The optimal choice is to end our turn and save our Knight card for a more impactful play later.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

4. Focus on rolling for resources and make strategic builds next turn
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

❓ Select action by number (0-1):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state to determine the best action:

## Game State Assessment
- I (BLUE) have 2 VP from 2 settlements
- RED has 3 VP from 3 settlements
- I have limited resources: 2 wood, 1 ore
- I currently hold 1 Knight development card
- The robber is on brick 9, which is blocking one of RED's productive hexes

## Action Options
- [0] Play Knight card - Move the robber and steal a resource
- [1] Roll the dice

## Analysis

**Option 0: Play Knight card**
Benefits:
- Could steal a valuable resource from RED
- Can move the robber to block RED's most productive hex
- Start building toward Largest Army (need 3+ knights)

Drawbacks:
- Limited strategic value given my current resources - even with an additional resource, I can't build anything significant
- RED only has 2 cards, so the chance of stealing something useful is low
- Knight cards are more valuable when protecting my productive hexes from the robber or when closer to securing Largest Army

**Option 1: Roll the dice**
Benefits:
- Potential to gather more resources for building
- I have a 6-ore hex and an 11-wheat hex that could give me high-value resources
- With a good roll, I could make meaningful progress toward a build
- Preserves the Knight card for more strategic use later

Drawbacks:
- Risk of rolling a 7 and losing resources if I end up with more than 7 cards
- Currently this isn't a risk as I only have 3 cards

## Strategic Consideration
My settlements are on nodes with 8-ore, 11-wheat, 3-wood, 5-sheep and 11-sheep. The best path forward is to gather resources for either:
1. Building a road toward the brick port at node 33
2. Gathering ore and wheat to upgrade a settlement to a city

<plan>
1. Roll for resources this turn to potentially get wheat/ore for city upgrades or wood/brick for expansion
2. Save Knight card for when we can protect our valuable 8-ore hex or when we're closer to Largest Army
3. Continue working toward our brick port at node 33 when we accumulate sufficient resources
4. Look to upgrade settlements to cities when we gather more ore and wheat
</plan>

Given my current position and resources, it's most strategic to roll the dice to gather more resources rather than using the Knight card, which would have limited impact right now.

# Turn Analysis for Blue Player

I need to decide whether to play my Knight card or end my turn without taking any action. Let's analyze the current game state and evaluate both options.

## Current Game State
- I (Blue) have 2 VP from 2 settlements
- Red has 3 VP from 3 settlements
- I have 2 wood, 1 ore and 1 Knight card
- The robber is currently on a 9-brick hex (2, -2, 0)
- My current plan involves working toward the brick port at node 33 and upgrading settlements

## Option 0: Play the Knight Card
Benefits:
- I could move the robber to a high-value hex that benefits Red
- I could steal one resource from Red
- Playing the Knight contributes to potentially gaining Largest Army (2 VP)

Drawbacks:
- I'd use my Knight now instead of saving it for a more critical moment
- Currently, I don't have enough resources to build anything meaningful after playing the Knight
- With only one played Knight, I'm still far from Largest Army (need 3)

## Option 1: End Turn
Benefits:
- Save the Knight card for a more strategically valuable moment
- Can use Knight when I have resources to build something with what I might steal
- Can use Knight when the robber threatens my high-value hexes

Drawbacks:
- Missing an opportunity to potentially get a useful resource from Red
- Another turn passes without making progress on the board

## Strategic Evaluation
Looking at our situation:
- I don't have enough resources to build anything this turn regardless
- The robber isn't currently affecting my resource production
- My Knight card will be more valuable when:
  * I have enough resources to build something with what I steal
  * I need to protect my key 8-ore or 11-wheat hexes
  * I'm closer to achieving Largest Army

<plan>
1. Save our Knight card for a more strategic moment (when we have resources to build with stolen resources or need to protect key hexes)
2. Focus on gathering wood/brick for expansion toward the brick port at node 33
3. Gather ore/wheat for city upgrades
4. Consider playing the Knight when it puts us closer to Largest Army
5. Protect our valuable 8-ore and 11-wheat hexes when threatened
</plan>

Based on this analysis, the optimal play is to end my turn and save the Knight card for a more opportune moment. I don't have enough resources to build anything significant after playing the Knight, and it isn't providing immediate strategic value in the current situation.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 22 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Save our Knight card for a more strategic moment (when we have resources to build with stolen resources or need to protect key hexes)

3. Gather ore/wheat for city upgrades
4. Consider playing the Knight when it puts us closer to Largest Army
5. Protect our valuable 8-ore and 11-wheat hexes when threatened

# Game Analysis - Turn 22

I need to decide between playing my Knight card now or rolling the dice to continue my regular turn.

## Analyzing my resource situation
- I have 2 Wood and 2 Ore
- With my current resources, I can't build anything immediately
- After rolling dice, I may get additional resources that allow me to build
- My settlements produce from Wheat (11), Ore (8), Wood (3), Sheep (5, 11) hexes

## Knight card considerations
**Reasons to play Knight now:**
- Move robber from the 9-Brick hex to target RED's production
- Steal a resource from RED who has 4 cards
- Potentially block RED's crucial resource production

**Reasons to save Knight:**
- I can't immediately use any stolen resource for building
- I don't have resources ready to build after playing Knight
- The Knight might be more valuable when I'm closer to getting Largest Army
- The robber isn't currently blocking any of my production

## Next steps evaluation
If I roll first:
- I might get resources that enable building
- I keep Knight for a more strategic moment, possibly when I have resources ready
- If I roll 7, I'd need to discard cards if I had 8+ resources (not a concern with 4 cards)

<plan>
1. Roll the dice now to attempt to gain more resources
2. Save Knight card for when I have resources to build with after stealing or when robber threatens my key hexes
3. Continue gathering resources for building toward brick port at node 33
4. Upgrade to a city when I collect 3 ore and 2 wheat
5. If robber gets placed on my key hexes (8-ore or 11-wheat), use Knight card to protect production
</plan>

Given that I can't immediately build anything even after playing the Knight card, and the robber isn't currently blocking any of my key production hexes, the optimal move is to roll first and save the Knight for a more impactful moment.

# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to determine the most strategic location to place the robber to maximize my chances of winning while hindering my opponent.

## Game State Assessment:
- I'm at 2 VPs vs RED's 3 VPs
- RED has 3 settlements while I only have 2
- RED currently has 4 hidden resource cards
- I have 2 wood, 2 ore, and 1 knight development card
- The robber is currently at (2, -2, 0), which is a brick hex with a value of 9

## Priorities for Robber Placement:
1. Disrupt RED's most valuable resource production
2. Steal a resource I need for my next build
3. Protect my own key production hexes
4. Ideally target a RED player with multiple settlements

## Key Resource Hexes for RED:
- Hex (1, -2, 1): Wood 6 [⭐⭐⭐] - Very high probability, RED has 1 settlement
- Hex (-2, 0, 2): Ore 8 [⭐⭐⭐] - Very high probability, RED has 1 settlement
- Hex (0, -1, 1): Sheep 11 [⭐] - Medium probability
- Hex (1, -1, 0): Wheat 4 [⭐] - Low probability, but RED has 2 settlements here

Looking at RED's settlements:
- Node 13: Gets ore from 8, wood from 5, sheep from 5
- Node 8: Gets wheat from 4, brick from 9, wood from 6
- Node 6: Gets wheat from 4, sheep from 12, wheat from 9

## Evaluating Options:
- Option [7] Move robber to (1, -2, 1) - This blocks RED's wood 6 production, which is very valuable
- Option [10] Move robber to (-2, 0, 2) - This blocks RED's ore 8 production, which is very valuable
- Option [1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) - This blocks wheat 4, affecting 2 of RED's settlements

Option [7] targets the high-value wood 6 hex, which is a very productive resource for RED. Wood is essential for roads and RED might be competing with me for the longest road.

Option [10] targets the high-value ore 8 hex, which is crucial for city upgrades. This would slow down RED's potential city development.

Option [1] impacts two of RED's settlements, but the wheat 4 is a low probability resource.

Looking at my plan, I want to build toward the brick port at node 33 and eventually upgrade to a city. I need ore and wheat for city upgrades, so blocking RED's key resources while potentially stealing what I need is ideal.

<plan>
1. Place robber on RED's high-value production hex to slow their progress
2. Continue gathering resources for building toward brick port at node 33
3. Prioritize getting wheat to combine with my ore for a city upgrade
4. Use Knight card when robber threatens my key production hexes
5. Focus on extending my road network to secure longest road bonus
</plan>

Given these considerations, blocking RED's ore production seems most strategic since ore is crucial for city upgrades, which provide the most efficient VP gain. Option [10] targets the high-value ore 8 hex.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Turn Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze my current situation and available options:

## Current Game State
- I have 2 victory points from 2 settlements
- My resources: 2 wood, 3 ore
- I have 1 knight development card
- Red has 3 victory points from 3 settlements
- Red is ahead of me by 1 point

## Option Analysis

### Option 0: Play Knight Card
If I play my knight card:
- I can move the robber from (-2, 0, 2) to another hex
- I can steal a resource from Red
- I would get closer to largest army (I'd have 1 knight played)
- The robber is currently on an ore hex with value 8, which is one of the best producing hexes

Potential targets for robber placement:
1. Hex (0, -1, 1) with wheat 4: This would block Red's settlement at node 6
2. Hex (1, -2, 1) with wood 6: This would block Red's settlement at node 8
3. Hex (2, -2, 0) with brick 9: This would also block Red's settlement at node 8

The best target appears to be the wood 6 hex or brick 9 hex, as they both affect Red's settlement at node 8, which has high-value production.

### Option 1: End Turn
- I have 2 wood and 3 ore, which isn't enough for any major build
- I can't build a settlement (need wood, brick, sheep, wheat)
- I can't build a city (need 3 ore + 2 wheat)
- I can't build a road (need wood + brick)
- I would simply retain my knight card for a future turn

## Decision Logic

Playing the knight card now would:
1. Disrupt Red's resource gathering
2. Give me a resource from Red
3. Start my progress toward largest army
4. Remove the robber from an ore hex (which isn't impacting me currently)

I need to consider if there's strategic value in saving the knight. Looking at the board, Red is ahead with 3 settlements to my 2. Disrupting their production could be valuable, especially if I can steal a useful resource.

<plan>
1. Play knight card to disrupt Red's high production settlement at node 8
2. Target the wood 6 hex to limit Red's wood production
3. Continue gathering resources for a city (need wheat) or new settlement
4. Focus on extending roads toward node 33 for the brick port
5. Work toward longest road as a path to victory
</plan>

The knight card provides immediate value by disrupting Red's production and potentially gaining a resource I need. Given Red's lead and my limited resources, playing the knight now is the optimal move.

# Move Robber Action Analysis

I need to analyze where to place the robber to maximize my advantage against Red, who is leading with 3 victory points.

## Resource Analysis
- Red has settlements at nodes 13, 8, and 6
- Red's most productive hexes:
  * Wood 6 (high value ⭐⭐⭐) at node 8
  * Ore 8 (high value ⭐⭐⭐) at node 13 (but already has robber)
  * Brick 9 (⭐⭐) at node 8
  * Wheat 9 (⭐⭐) at node 6
  * Sheep 5 (⭐⭐) at node 13
- Red has a very strong setup with good number distribution

## My Current Situation
- I have 2 wood and 3 ore
- Need wheat to build a city
- Need brick for additional roads and settlements
- I'm behind in points (2 vs Red's 3)

## Strategic Options
1. Block Red's wood 6 production (action #8)
   - This is highly productive (⭐⭐⭐)
   - Blocks a critical expansion resource
   - Lets me steal a resource from Red

2. Block Red's wheat production (actions #1 or #17)
   - Would prevent Red from building cities
   - Red has access to wheat from two settlements

3. Block Red's brick production (action #7)
   - Would slow Red's expansion capabilities
   - Brick 9 is moderately productive (⭐⭐)

<plan>
1. Move robber to block Red's wood 6 hex (high production value)
2. Focus on building roads toward node 33 for brick port access
3. Trade my abundant ore for wheat to build a city
4. Continue working toward longest road (2 VP) as path to victory
5. Consider development cards for potential hidden VP or knights
</plan>

The most strategic option is to block Red's wood 6 hex, which is a high-production tile (⭐⭐⭐). This would significantly slow Red's expansion capabilities while allowing me to steal a potentially useful resource. Wood is critical for early-game expansion, and limiting Red's access to it will help me catch up in the settlement race.

Action #8 is the optimal choice: Move robber to (1, -2, 1) and steal from RED.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 22 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Move robber to block Red's wood 6 hex (high production value)
2. Focus on building roads toward node 33 for brick port access

5. Consider development cards for potential hidden VP or knights

# Game Analysis for Turn 22

Let me analyze the current game state and my available options to make the optimal decision:

## Current Game State
- I (BLUE) have 2 VP from 2 settlements
- RED has 3 VP from 3 settlements
- I have 2 🌲WOOD and 4 ⛏️ORE resources
- I have 5 roads built (longest road is 4)
- The robber is on a wood 6 hex (1, -2, 1)

## Victory Point Gap
RED is ahead by 1 VP. I need 8 more points to win, while RED needs 7 more.

## Resource Analysis
I have 2 wood and 4 ore. I'm missing wheat, brick, and sheep.

## Available Actions
0. End turn
1-4. Trade 4 ore for 1 of wheat/brick/sheep/wood using the 4:1 general trade rate

## Strategic Considerations

Looking at my current plan:
1. The robber is already on Red's wood 6 hex, so that part is done
2. Building roads toward node 33 for brick port access makes sense for future turns
3. Trading ore for wheat to build a city would be valuable
4. Working toward longest road is a good path (I have 4 roads in a sequence, need 5 for the bonus)

Currently, I don't have enough resources to build anything:
- City needs 3 ore + 2 wheat (I have 4 ore but no wheat)
- Settlement needs 1 wood + 1 brick + 1 wheat + 1 sheep (I have only wood)
- Road needs 1 wood + 1 brick (I have wood but no brick)
- Development card needs 1 ore + 1 wheat + 1 sheep (I have ore but no wheat or sheep)

The trade options are all at the standard 4:1 rate, which is very inefficient. 

My best immediate goal is to acquire brick to build roads toward node 33 (brick port) or wheat for city development. With my current plan of focusing on roads toward the brick port and then building cities, getting brick seems most urgent.

<plan>
1. Trade 4 ore for 1 brick to continue road building toward node 33 (brick port)
2. Continue expanding road network toward brick port for better trading options
3. Focus on acquiring wheat next to work toward city upgrades
4. Aim for longest road (2 VP) as part of my path to victory
5. Monitor RED's expansion and adjust strategy accordingly
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I'll trade 4 ore for 1 brick:

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan, Turn 22

I'll analyze my current position, resources, and available actions to make the optimal decision.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 2 VP (2 settlements)
- I have 2 wood and 1 brick in hand
- RED has 3 VP (3 settlements)
- I previously planned to trade for brick to build toward node 33 (brick port)
- My current road network has a length of 4, no longest road bonus yet

## Resource Analysis
- I have exactly enough resources (2 wood, 1 brick) to build one road
- My settlements produce wood, sheep, wheat, and ore, but I'm currently lacking good brick production
- Getting a brick port would help compensate for my weak brick production

## Strategic Considerations
Let me analyze the road building options and their strategic value:

1. Edge (10, 11): This moves toward the center but doesn't clearly lead to a port or strong expansion location
2. Edge (45, 46): Near the wheat port, but far from my current settlements
3. Edge (3, 4): Connects to my existing settlement but leads toward the center without clear expansion opportunity
4. Edge (19, 20): Connects to my settlement at node 19 and moves toward a strong future settlement spot
5. Edge (12, 13): Moves toward RED's settlement, not strategically valuable
6. Edge (31, 32): Moves toward the brick port - aligns with my current plan
7. Edge (2, 3): Connects to my settlement but with limited expansion potential
8. Edge (46, 48): Near the wheat port but disconnected from my network
9. Edge (33, 34): Not directly contributing to reaching the brick port
10. Edge (19, 21): Extends from my settlement at 19 toward future expansion

## Priority Road Analysis

Looking at my options in context of my current plan:
- Option #6 (edge 31, 32) directly advances my plan to reach the brick port
- Option #4 (edge 19, 20) expands from my well-positioned settlement
- Option #10 (edge 19, 21) also expands from my settlement in a different direction

## Decision Making

Building road at edge (31, 32) is most aligned with my current strategic plan of reaching the brick port. This port would give me a 2:1 trade ratio for brick, which addresses one of my resource weaknesses. The brick port will be a valuable long-term asset given my current resource production.

<plan>
1. Build road at edge (31, 32) toward the brick port (uses all my current resources)
2. Continue expanding toward the brick port to secure better trading options
3. Once I reach the brick port, focus on settlement placement for maximum resource diversity
4. Target wheat and ore production to enable city upgrades 
5. Continue building roads toward promising settlement locations while aiming for longest road bonus (2 VP)
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I will build a road at edge (31, 32), continuing my path to the brick port.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 24 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build road at edge (31, 32) toward the brick port (uses all my current resources)
2. Continue expanding toward the brick port to secure better trading options
3. Once I reach the brick port, focus on settlement placement for maximum resource diversity

# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to analyze where to place the robber to maximize my strategic advantage while hindering my opponent who is ahead of me in victory points.

## Game State Assessment
- I have 2 VP vs RED's 3 VP
- RED has 3 settlements vs my 2 settlements
- RED has 3 hidden resource cards
- I have limited resources: just 1 wood and 1 ore

## Robber Placement Options Analysis

Let me analyze the most impactful options:

1. **Option [7] - Move robber to (2, -2, 0) and steal from RED**
   - This is a brick hex with number 9
   - Affects RED's settlement at node 8
   - Blocks brick production which RED needs for expansion

2. **Option [10] - Move robber to (-2, 0, 2) and steal from RED**
   - This is an ore hex with number 8 (high probability)
   - Affects RED's settlement at node 13
   - Blocks a valuable 8 ore hex

3. **Option [1] - Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED**
   - This is a wheat hex with number 4
   - Affects RED's settlements at nodes 6 and 8
   - Blocks wheat production from two of RED's settlements

4. **Option [17] - Move robber to (2, -1, -1) and steal from RED**
   - This is a wheat hex with number 9
   - Affects RED's settlement at node 6
   - Blocks a moderate wheat producer

## Strategic Decision

Looking at RED's settlements, they have good access to all resources. Blocking a high-probability number that RED has access to would be most beneficial.

The ore hex with a number 8 at (-2, 0, 2) is particularly valuable because:
1. It's a high-probability hex (8)
2. Ore is critical for city upgrades and development cards
3. RED has a settlement there at node 13

<plan>
1. Disrupt RED's ore production by placing robber on the 8 ore hex
2. Continue with my road expansion plan toward the brick port
3. Focus on getting settlements at locations with wheat and ore to enable city upgrades
4. Work toward longest road (2 VP) for a path to victory
</plan>

Option [10] gives me the best strategic advantage by blocking a high-value ore hex and potentially stealing an ore from RED.

- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 26 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Disrupt RED's ore production by placing robber on the 8 ore hex
2. Continue with my road expansion plan toward the brick port
3. Focus on getting settlements at locations with wheat and ore to enable city upgrades
4. Work toward longest road (2 VP) for a path to victory
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze my current position and options in this game of Settlers of Catan.

## Current Game State
- I have 2 VP from my 2 settlements
- Resources: 1 🌲WOOD, 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 3 ⛏️ORE
- Opponent has 3 VP from 3 settlements
- The robber is on the 8 ore hex (-2, 0, 2), already blocking a key resource

## Available Actions
- [0] End turn
- [1] Buy a development card (1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE)

## Resource Analysis
I have exactly the resources needed to buy a development card. If I don't buy one, I'll keep these resources for my next turn, but risk losing some if a 7 is rolled.

## Strategic Considerations
1. **Development Card Benefits**:
   - Could be a Victory Point card (immediate hidden VP)
   - Could be a Knight (moving robber, counting toward Largest Army)
   - Could be a Road Building, Year of Plenty, or Monopoly card

2. **Current Plan Evaluation**:
   My current plan involves disrupting RED's ore production and expanding toward the brick port. The robber is already on RED's ore hex, which aligns with my plan. Buying a development card doesn't directly help with road expansion, but could provide strategic advantages.

3. **VP Path Analysis**:
   - I'm behind in VP (2 vs. RED's 3)
   - I need a pathway to gain VP quickly
   - Development cards could provide hidden VP or knights toward Largest Army (2 VP)

4. **Risk Assessment**:
   - If I end turn without buying anything, I risk losing resources if a 7 is rolled
   - RED might place the robber on my 8 ore hex, hampering my production

<plan>
1. Buy development cards to potentially gain hidden VP or knights
2. Continue building roads toward promising settlement locations
3. Work toward settlements at locations with wheat and ore for city upgrades
4. Maintain focus on longest road (2 VP) as a path to victory
5. If I get knights, use them to protect my key production hexes
</plan>

## Decision
Given my current position and the fact that I have exactly the right resources for a development card, buying one is the optimal choice. This could give me a hidden VP, a knight to move the robber, or a useful action card. Additionally, it prevents me from potentially losing resources to a "7" roll while making progress toward my victory path.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible

# Game Analysis for Turn 28

Let me analyze the current game state and available options carefully:

## Game State Analysis
- I have 2 VP (2 settlements)
- Red has 3 VP (3 settlements)
- I have 1 wood, 2 ore, and 1 unused knight card
- Robber is currently on a key hex - ore 8 at (-2, 0, 2)
- I have longest road potential with 6 roads built (longest sequence: 4)

## Options Analysis
I have two options available:
1. **[0] Play Knight card** - Move the robber and steal a resource
2. **[1] Roll the dice**

### Option 0: Play Knight Card
- Benefits:
  - Move robber from ore 8 hex (which might be blocking my production)
  - Steal a resource from Red who has 4 cards
  - Contribute toward Largest Army (I would have 2 knights played)
  - Protected against potential resource loss if I roll a 7

### Option 1: Roll the Dice
- Benefits:
  - Might get more resources to build with
  - Save knight for future defensive use
- Risks:
  - Rolling a 7 would force me to discard half my cards if I have more than 7 (not currently an issue)
  - The robber stays on the ore 8 hex, potentially blocking my production

## Decision Making
Looking at the board, I notice the robber is currently on an ore 8 hex (-2, 0, 2). This hex is connected to one of Red's settlements at node 13, but it doesn't appear to be connected to any of my settlements. My settlement at node 19 produces from ore 8, but that's a different hex at (0, 2, -2).

Since the robber isn't directly impacting my production and I only have 3 resource cards (well below the 7-card discard threshold), it makes more sense to roll the dice. I should save my knight card for when:
1. The robber is placed on one of my productive hexes
2. I need a specific resource from an opponent
3. I'm closer to achieving Largest Army

<plan>
1. Roll the dice to gather more resources
2. Continue building roads toward promising settlement locations
3. Work toward settlements at locations with wheat and ore for city upgrades
4. Maintain focus on longest road (2 VP) as a path to victory
5. Save knight card for when robber threatens my key production hexes

# Analyzing Game State for Optimal Action

I'll carefully assess the current board state and my options to determine the best move.

## Current Game Status
- **Victory Points**: I (BLUE) have 2/10 VP, RED has 3/10 VP
- **My Resources**: 1 Wood, 2 Ore
- **My Development Cards**: 1 Knight (unplayed)
- **Road Status**: I have the longer road network (6 roads with longest segment of 4), RED has 5 roads with longest segment of 3
- **Robber**: Currently on Ore (8) hex (-2, 0, 2) - this is a high-value hex
- **Available Actions**: Play Knight card OR End turn

## Strategic Assessment

1. **Resource Analysis**:
   - I only have 1 Wood + 2 Ore, which is not enough for any building (settlement needs 1W+1B+1S+1Wh; city needs 3O+2Wh)
   - With limited resources, my building options are very constrained this turn

2. **Knight Card Considerations**:
   - Playing the Knight would:
     - Move the robber from the Ore (8) hex
     - Let me steal a resource from RED who has 5 cards
     - Count toward Largest Army (currently nobody holds this)
   - The Ore (8) hex currently blocked by the robber is a crucial production hex, marked with ⭐⭐⭐
   - I see that both my settlement at node 19 and RED's settlement at node 13 produce from this hex

3. **Board Position**:
   - I'm working toward longest road (have 4 consecutive roads currently)
   - Unblocking the Ore (8) hex would improve my future production potential
   - RED is ahead in victory points (3 vs. my 2)

## Decision Logic

The Ore (8) hex is a high-probability tile (8 is second only to 6) currently blocked by the robber. This significantly affects both my production and RED's production. Playing the Knight card would:

1. Unblock this valuable Ore resource for future turns
2. Allow me to steal a resource from RED, potentially getting something I need
3. Move toward achieving Largest Army (2 VP) with my second Knight
4. Slow RED's progress by placing the robber on one of their productive hexes

Given that I don't have enough resources for building anyway, and the ore tile being blocked is highly valuable, playing the Knight card is clearly the optimal move.

<plan>
1. Play Knight card to move robber from the Ore (8) hex to a productive RED hex
2. Continue building toward longest road (need 5 consecutive roads for 2 VP)
3. Look for settlement opportunities at nodes with wheat and ore access
4. Begin accumulating resources for city upgrades (3 ore + 2 wheat each)
5. Work toward Largest Army (need 1 more Knight)
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

RESPONSE:
# Analyzing Robber Placement Options

I need to move the robber strategically to hinder my opponent's (RED) resource production while possibly gaining a resource through stealing.

## Current Game State Analysis:
- RED has 3 settlements vs. my 2, giving them a 3-2 VP advantage
- RED player has 5 hidden resources
- The robber is currently on an Ore (8) hex, which affects my own settlement at node 19
- I need to move it elsewhere to unblock my own good Ore production

## Evaluating Target Hexes:
Let me examine RED's settlements and their production:
- Node 13: 🐑5[⭐⭐], 🌲5[⭐⭐], ⛏️8[⭐⭐⭐] - currently blocked by robber
- Node 8: 🌾4[⭐], 🧱9[⭐⭐], 🌲6[⭐⭐⭐]
- Node 6: 🌾4[⭐], 🐑12, 🌾9[⭐⭐]

The most valuable hex for RED is the Wood (6) hex at (1, -2, 1) which produces at a ⭐⭐⭐ probability.

## Evaluating Each Action:
Looking at the options, action [8] lets me move the robber to (1, -2, 1) and steal from RED. This targets the Wood (6) hex, which:
1. Blocks RED's strong wood production
2. Hurts a critical expansion resource
3. Allows me to steal from RED, potentially getting a needed resource
4. Doesn't block any of my own production

<plan>
1. Move robber to Wood (6) hex to block RED's strong production
2. Focus on building my road network toward good settlement locations
3. Use my ore to either buy development cards or save for city upgrades
4. Try to secure longest road (need 5 consecutive roads for 2 VP)
5. Continue looking for settlement opportunities with access to wheat
</plan>

Targeting RED's Wood (6) hex is the optimal move, as wood is critical for roads and settlements. This will slow RED's expansion while freeing up my own Ore production.

# Game Analysis for Settler of Catan - Turn 30

Let me analyze the current game state carefully to make the optimal decision.

## Current Game State
- I (BLUE) have 2 VP vs RED's 4 VP
- I have 1 wood, 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 2 ore
- I've played 2 Knights and 1 Road Building card previously
- The robber is on the Wood(6) hex, blocking one of RED's strong production spots
- Available actions: End Turn [0] or Buy Development Card [1]

## Development Card Analysis
Buying a development card costs 1 sheep + 1 wheat + 1 ore, which I have exactly.

Benefits:
- Could get a Victory Point card (immediate hidden VP)
- Could get a Knight (move toward Largest Army, 2 VP)
- Could get Road Building (help toward Longest Road, 2 VP)
- Could get Year of Plenty or Monopoly (resource advantage)

I already have 2 knights played, so I'm 1 away from Largest Army.

## Resource Management
If I don't buy a development card, I'll keep:
- 1 wood, 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 2 ore
These resources aren't enough for any other build (settlement or city), and I would need to wait for more rolls to do anything meaningful.

## Strategic Position
- RED is at 4 VP, double my score
- I need to accelerate my path to victory
- Development cards are the only progress I can make this turn
- I already have 2 knights played, getting a 3rd would secure Largest Army (2 VP)

<plan>
1. Buy a development card hoping for a Knight or VP card
2. Work toward securing Largest Army (need 1 more Knight)
3. Look for settlement opportunities using my existing road network
4. Aim to upgrade to cities once I secure more ore and wheat
5. Continue blocking RED's strong production with the robber when possible
</plan>

Since I can't build anything else this turn and holding my resources doesn't provide any immediate advantage, buying a development card is clearly the best move. It has the potential to advance my position through a Victory Point card, Knight (for Largest Army), or helpful action card.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current situation carefully:

## Victory Points
- BLUE (me): 2 VP (from 2 settlements)
- RED: 4 VP (from 4 settlements)

RED is ahead by 2 points, which is significant but not insurmountable.

## Resources
- I have: 1 🌲WOOD, 1 ⛏️ORE
- I already have 1 unplayed KNIGHT card
- I've played 2 KNIGHT cards already (plus a road building card)

## Strategic Options

I have two possible actions:
- [0] Play Knight card - Move the robber and steal a resource
- [1] Roll the dice

Let me think about each:

### Option 0: Play Knight
If I play my Knight card:
- I'd have played 3 Knight cards total, which would give me Largest Army (2 VP)
- I could move the robber to a high-producing hex for RED (like the 8 ore or 6 wood)
- I could steal a resource from RED
- This would increase my VP count from 2 to 4, tying with RED

### Option 1: Roll the Dice
- This is the standard turn beginning
- I have very few resources, so getting more through a roll would be helpful
- However, I don't have enough resources to build anything significant right now

## Decision Analysis

Playing the Knight card now would:
1. Immediately tie me with RED at 4 VP
2. Potentially disrupt RED's strong production
3. Allow me to steal a resource (potentially something valuable)

However, I should first consider if I should save the Knight for immediate defensive purposes:
- If I roll a 7, I'd waste this Knight opportunity
- If RED has high-probability hexes that produce in the next turn, disrupting now could be valuable

Looking at the board, the robber is already on the 6 🌲 hex at (1,-2,1), which is a strong production hex for RED.

<plan>
1. Play Knight card now to secure Largest Army (2 VP)
2. Move robber to the 8 ⛏️ hex at (0,2,-2) where RED has a settlement
3. Continue building road network toward potential settlement locations
4. Work toward city upgrades when ore/wheat become available
5. Monitor RED's expansion carefully and block when possible
</plan>

Since RED is ahead and has strong production, and I can immediately gain 2 VP through Largest Army, the strategically optimal choice is to play my Knight card.

RESPONSE:
I need to analyze the best place to move the robber to maximize my chances of winning.

First, let's assess the current game state:
- BLUE (me): 4/10 VP (2 settlements + Largest Army bonus)
- RED: 4/10 VP (4 settlements)
- We're tied in points, but RED has more settlements, giving them better resource production
- I only have 1 wood and 1 ore in my hand
- There's no Longest Road bonus yet, which is a potential 2 VP opportunity

Let's analyze my robber placement options to determine the most strategically effective move:

1. I should target RED's high-probability production hexes
2. I should prioritize resources that RED needs and I might need
3. Stealing a useful resource would be ideal

Looking at RED's settlements:
- RED has settlements at 6, 8, 13, and 15
- RED has access to all resource types
- RED has strong production on 8s (ore and wheat), 6s (wood), 9s (brick and wheat), and 5s (sheep and wood)

The most valuable hexes to block are:
- ⛏️8 at (0,2,-2) - Option [14]: Blocks RED's ore production at node 13, high probability resource
- 🧱9 at (2,-2,0) - Option [7]: Blocks RED's brick at node 8
- 🌲6 at (1,-2,1) - Already has the robber
- 🌾4 at (1,-1,0) - Option [1]: Blocks RED's wheat at nodes 6 and 8
- ⛏️6 at (-1,1,0) - Option [4]: Blocks RED's ore at node 15

Looking at the most impactful options:
- Option [14] blocks an 8-ore hex where RED has a settlement - highest probability resource
- Option [10] blocks an 8-ore hex that RED has a settlement on at node 13
- Option [4] blocks a 6-ore hex that RED has a settlement on at node 15
- Option [1] impacts RED's wheat production on two settlements (nodes 6 and 8)

According to my plan, I wanted to move the robber to the 8⛏️ hex at (0,2,-2) where RED has a settlement. This is option [14]. This move blocks a high-probability ore resource that RED likely needs for city upgrades, which aligns with my strategy of hindering their progress.

One consideration: option [14] doesn't allow me to steal from RED since they don't have a settlement directly on that hex (only at node 13 which is on the edge). However, option [10] allows me to block the 8⛏️ hex at (-2,0,2) where RED has a settlement at node 13, AND steal a resource.

Since stealing a resource is valuable in my resource-poor position, and both options block an 8-ore hex, option [10] is the optimal choice. This blocks a high probability ore hex AND lets me steal from RED.

<plan>
1. Move robber to (-2,0,2) to block RED's ore production and steal a resource
2. Continue building road network toward potential settlement locations when resources allow
3. Work toward city upgrades when more ore/wheat become available
4. Monitor RED's expansion carefully and block when possible
5. Aim to secure Longest Road (2 VP) since I'm ahead in road count
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 42 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Move robber to (-2,0,2) to block RED's ore production and steal a resource
2. Continue building road network toward potential settlement locations when resources allow
3. Work toward city upgrades when more ore/wheat become available
4. Monitor RED's expansion carefully and block when possible
5. Aim to secure Longest Road (2 VP) since I'm ahead in road count

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and available options to determine the optimal action.

## Current Game State
- I (BLUE) have 4 VP: 2 from settlements + 2 from Largest Army
- RED also has 4 VP from 4 settlements
- I have 3 Wood, 1 Sheep, 4 Ore resources
- RED has 10 hidden resource cards (possibly hoarding for a big move)
- The robber is currently on wheat (0,1,-1)
- I have 12 roads vs RED's 14 roads (RED could be working toward Longest Road)

## Available Actions
Since it's my turn and I've already rolled (past the resource gathering phase), my options are:
- [0] End my turn
- [1] Trade 4 Ore for 1 Wheat
- [2] Trade 4 Ore for 1 Brick
- [3] Trade 4 Ore for 1 more Sheep
- [4] Trade 4 Ore for 1 more Wood

## Resource Assessment
I currently have:
- Wood (3): Decent amount
- Sheep (1): Low
- Ore (4): Abundant
- Wheat (0): None
- Brick (0): None

## Strategic Options

1. **End Turn Option**:
   * Pros: Save resources for future turns
   * Cons: Make no progress this turn, allow RED to continue their plan

2. **Trade Options**:
   * Using 4:1 trade with the bank is very inefficient
   * However, with 4 Ore and nothing to build this turn, trading could enable future actions
   * What could I do with different resources?
     - Wheat: Need for city (3 ore + 2 wheat) or development card (1 ore + 1 wheat + 1 sheep)
     - Brick: Need for road (1 wood + 1 brick) or settlement (1 wood + 1 brick + 1 wheat + 1 sheep)
     - More Sheep: Could help toward development card
     - More Wood: Already have 3, not a high priority

## Decision Reasoning

Looking at my planned goals, I want to:
1. Block RED's expansion and protect my position
2. Work toward city upgrades
3. Continue road building for potential Longest Road

Trading 4 Ore for 1 Wheat [1] seems most strategic because:
- Wheat is needed for both cities and development cards
- Currently I have 0 wheat, making it my most critical missing resource
- With 1 wheat, 1 sheep, and some of my ore, I could buy a development card next turn (could be a VP card)
- Trading 4 ore is inefficient, but ore is my most abundant resource and I can't use it effectively without other resources
- Keeping resources without making progress allows RED to continue their plan

<plan>
1. Trade 4 ore for 1 wheat this turn
2. Look to acquire sheep and more wheat for development cards
3. Continue building road network toward potential settlement locations
4. Work toward city upgrades when more ore/wheat become available
5. Monitor RED's expansion carefully and block when possible
6. Aim to secure Longest Road (2 VP) as it appears RED is also working toward this

- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 44 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Trade 4 ore for 1 wheat this turn
2. Look to acquire sheep and more wheat for development cards
3. Continue building road network toward potential settlement locations
4. Work toward city upgrades when more ore/wheat become available
5. Monitor RED's expansion carefully and block when possible
6. Aim to secure Longest Road (2 VP) as it appears RED is also working toward this

# Game Analysis for Turn 44

Let me analyze the current game state and determine the best action.

## Victory Point Assessment
- BLUE (me): 4 VP (2 settlements + 2 VP for largest army)
- RED: 7 VP (3 settlements + 1 city + 2 VP for longest road)

RED is 3 points ahead and only needs 3 more points to win, which could be achieved with 1 city upgrade (1 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) or other combinations.

## Resource Analysis
- I have: 5 wood, 2 sheep, 1 wheat
- I need more ore and wheat for city upgrades, and possibly brick for expansion

## Strategic Options
Let me evaluate the available actions:
- [0] End turn: This would waste my opportunity to improve my position
- [1] Trade 4 wood → 1 sheep: I already have 2 sheep; getting a third sheep gives me little benefit
- [2] Trade 4 wood → 1 ore: Getting ore would be useful for future cities or development cards
- [3] Trade 4 wood → 1 wheat: With my existing 1 wheat, this would give me 2 wheat
- [4] Trade 4 wood → 1 brick: Useful for road building, potentially settlements

## Decision Logic
I'm 3 points behind RED who has 7 VP. I need to accelerate my point acquisition. My options:

1. With my current plan focused on getting wheat, trading for wheat (option 3) aligns well
2. If I get 1 more wheat (for a total of 2), plus my 2 sheep, I'll have 2 wheat + 2 sheep - enough to buy a development card on a future turn
3. Development cards could give me a VP card or more knights to secure my largest army bonus

Given I already have largest army (2 VP), buying development cards is a strong strategy. I need wheat for this.

<plan>
1. Trade 4 wood for 1 wheat this turn
2. Next turn, look to acquire 1 more ore to pair with my 2 sheep + 2 wheat for development cards
3. Continue building road network toward potential settlement locations when resources allow
4. Work toward city upgrades when more ore becomes available
5. Monitor RED's expansion carefully and block when possible
6. Continue developing longest road to challenge RED for that 2 VP bonus
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I'll choose action 3 to trade 4 wood for 1 wheat, which supports my development card strategy.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and my available options:

## Victory Point Status
- BLUE (me): 4 VP (2 settlements + Largest Army bonus)
- RED: 7 VP (3 settlements + 1 city + Longest Road bonus)

RED is at 7/10 VP, just 3 points away from winning, which means I need to make strategic moves to catch up.

## Resource Analysis
My current resources: 3 Wood, 2 Sheep, 2 Wheat, 1 Ore

## Available Actions
1. Buy a development card (costs 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore)
2. End turn

## Development Card Consideration
If I buy a development card, I would have:
- 25% chance of getting a Victory Point card (immediate hidden VP)
- 50% chance of getting a Knight (could strengthen my Largest Army position)
- 25% chance of getting another helpful card (Year of Plenty, Monopoly, Road Building)

Given that RED is at 7 VP, and I'm only at 4 VP, I need to maximize my chances of gaining points. Development cards could provide hidden VP or Knights to secure my Largest Army bonus.

## Strategic Evaluation
- RED has Longest Road (5 segments) while my longest is only 4, so challenging for Longest Road isn't immediate
- I already have Largest Army with 3 knights, but securing it with additional knights would be prudent
- I can't build any settlements or cities this turn
- The development card pool still has 21 cards, meaning there's a good chance of drawing useful cards

## Plan Adjustment
<plan>
1. Buy a development card this turn to potentially gain a VP card or strengthen Largest Army
2. Work on accumulating resources for settlements or cities next turn
3. Continue to expand road network toward potential settlement spots
4. Eventually challenge RED for Longest Road
5. Monitor RED's expansion carefully and block when possible
6. Aim for city upgrades when more ore becomes available
</plan>

Buying a development card is my best option this turn. It uses my ore which I might otherwise struggle to use efficiently, and gives me a chance at either a direct VP or a knight to secure my Largest Army bonus against RED.

1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 50 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Buy a development card this turn to potentially gain a VP card or strengthen Largest Army
2. Work on accumulating resources for settlements or cities next turn
3. Continue to expand road network toward potential settlement spots
4. Eventually challenge RED for Longest Road
5. Monitor RED's expansion carefully and block when possible
6. Aim for city upgrades when more ore becomes available

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze the current game state and available options:

## Game State Summary
- **Victory Points**: BLUE (me) has 4 VP, RED has 9 VP (RED is one point away from winning)
- **My Resources**: 4 Wood, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat (limited options)
- **Development Cards**: I have 1 hidden Victory Point card
- **Special Bonuses**: I have Largest Army (3 knights, +2 VP), RED has Longest Road (+2 VP)

## Immediate Threat Assessment
RED is at 9 VP, just one point away from winning. They could win on their next turn by:
- Building another settlement (if they have or can get the resources)
- Upgrading a settlement to a city
- Playing a hidden VP development card

## Available Action Analysis:
0. End Turn: This does nothing to improve my position or block RED.
1-4. Maritime Trade: Trade 4 wood for 1 of another resource.

Unfortunately, even with any trade, I can't:
- Build a road (need wood + brick)
- Build a settlement (need wood + brick + sheep + wheat)
- Build a city (need 3 ore + 2 wheat)
- Buy a development card (need ore + sheep + wheat)

My current resources and available options are extremely limited. None of the available actions allow me to make significant progress or effectively block RED.

## Strategic Considerations:
1. RED is one point from winning, and I have no way to block them with my current resources
2. Trading 4 wood for another resource doesn't enable any builds this turn
3. Since I can't make meaningful progress this turn, I should end my turn and hope for better dice rolls next time

<plan>
1. End turn and hope for better resource production next turn
2. On next turn, focus on building settlements to gain VP quickly
3. Consider targeting RED's potential expansion spots to slow them down
4. If possible, work toward breaking RED's Longest Road by building strategically 
5. Reveal my VP card only when it will secure victory
</plan>

Since none of the trading options (1-4) enable a strategic build this turn, and the trades would deplete my wood reserves without immediate benefit, the most reasonable option is to end my turn.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

# Game Analysis: Settlers of Catan Turn 52

I'll analyze this critical game position carefully as I need to make the optimal decision to prevent RED from winning.

## Current Game Status Overview
- RED has 9/10 victory points (close to winning)
- I (BLUE) have 4/10 victory points (plus 1 hidden VP card = 5 total)
- RED has the Longest Road bonus (2 VP)
- I have the Largest Army bonus (2 VP)
- My resources: 4 Wood, 2 Sheep, 1 Wheat
- RED has 9 hidden cards

## Strategic Assessment

The situation is desperate. RED is at 9 VP and needs just 1 more to win. With 9 hidden cards, they likely have resources for a settlement, city upgrade, or development card. I must make progress or RED will likely win on their next turn.

With my current resources (4 Wood, 2 Sheep, 1 Wheat), I can't:
- Build a settlement (need brick)
- Build a city (need ore and wheat)
- Buy a development card (need ore and wheat)
- Build enough roads to challenge longest road

## Options Analysis

Let's review my available actions:
- [0] End turn: Gives RED their turn and likely lets them win
- [1-4] Maritime trades: Trade 4 Wood for a resource (Sheep, Ore, Wheat, or Brick)

Since I already have 2 Sheep, trading for another Sheep isn't helpful.
Trading for Wheat would give me 2 Wheat, but I'd still lack Ore for a city or dev card.
Trading for Ore would give me 1 Ore, but I'd still need more Ore or other resources.
Trading for Brick would give me 1 Brick, but I'd need more resources to build anything useful.

None of the maritime trades meaningfully advance my position this turn, and I would deplete my Wood surplus without gaining an immediate advantage.

<plan>
1. End turn and preserve resources
2. Hope for favorable dice rolls next turn
3. Based on future resources, prioritize building a settlement (if I get brick) or buying development cards (if I get ore)
4. Look for opportunities to interfere with RED's win condition
5. Only reveal my VP card when I can reach 10 VP
</plan>

Since none of the trades would realistically help me stop RED or make significant progress toward victory, my best option is to maintain my resource position and hope for better rolls next turn.

2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 54 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. End turn and preserve resources
2. Hope for favorable dice rolls next turn
3. Based on future resources, prioritize building a settlement (if I get brick) or buying development cards (if I get ore)
4. Look for opportunities to interfere with RED's win condition
5. Only reveal my VP card when I can reach 10 VP

Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze this critical game state and make an optimal decision.

## Game Analysis

1) **Game Status Overview**:
   - I have 4 VP: 2 settlements + 2 VP from Largest Army
   - I have 1 hidden Victory Point card
   - My actual VP total is 5/10
   - RED has 9/10 VP and is about to win
   - RED has 10 hidden resources

2) **Resource Analysis**:
   - I have 4 Wood, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat
   - I can't build any meaningful structures with these resources
   - I need Ore and Brick most critically

3) **Position Analysis**:
   - RED is one VP away from winning
   - I need to prevent RED from winning while building toward victory myself
   - My 12 roads vs RED's 18 indicates I'm not in position to contest Longest Road

4) **Available Actions**:
   - End turn
   - Trade 4 Wood for another resource via 3:1 port

## Strategic Considerations

RED is at 9 points and likely has resources to build something on their next turn to win. I can't directly interfere with them right now. My best move is to position myself for maximum flexibility on my next turn.

Looking at maritime trades:
- Trading 4 Wood for Brick would let me build 1 road
- Trading 4 Wood for Ore would let me buy a development card if I also get another Ore
- Trading 4 Wood for Wheat would give me 2 Wheat (with my existing 1), still not enough for a development card
- Trading 4 Wood for Sheep would give me 2 Sheep, which doesn't help my immediate needs

None of these trades give me an immediate powerful play. With no ability to directly interfere with RED, I should preserve flexibility.

<plan>
1. End turn to preserve resources
2. Hope for favorable dice rolls next turn
3. Based on future resources, prioritize building a settlement (if I get brick) or buying development cards (if I get ore)
4. Look for opportunities to interfere with RED's win condition
5. Only reveal my VP card when I can reach 10 VP
</plan>

I'll end my turn to maintain maximum flexibility for my next turn. Trading away my wood leaves me with fewer options if I roll good resources next turn.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

# Initial Settlement Placement Analysis

I need to choose the optimal location for my first settlement in the initial placement phase. This is a critical decision as it will impact my entire game strategy.

## Analyzing High-Value Nodes

Let me analyze the board looking for several key attributes:
1. Nodes connected to high-probability numbers (6 & 8)
2. Resource diversity (ideally 3 different resources)
3. Future expansion potential
4. Access to ports (especially 2:1 ports)

Looking at the hexes with the best numbers:
- 🌲6 (0, 0, 0) - Wood with probability 6
- 🐑6 (0, 1, -1) - Sheep with probability 6 
- 🧱8 (-2, 2, 0) - Brick with probability 8

Let me identify nodes connected to these valuable hexes:

Node 0: Connected to Wood(6) and Sheep(6) - gives two high-probability resources
Node 5: Connected to Wood(6) and Sheep(6) - same as node 0
Nodes 14, 17: Connected to Brick(8) hexes - high-probability brick

## Best Candidates Analysis

Node 0 looks particularly strong as it connects to:
- 🌲6 (Wood) - high probability
- 🐑6 (Sheep) - high probability
- 🐑8 (Sheep) - good probability

Node 17 connects to:
- 🧱8 (Brick) - high probability
- 🧱10 (Brick) - decent probability
- 🐑2 (Sheep) - low probability

Node 2 connects to:
- 🌲6 (Wood) - high probability
- 🧱11 (Brick) - decent probability
- ⛏️5 (Ore) - access to ore which is crucial for cities

Node 10 connects to:
- 🌾5 (Wheat) - good probability
- 🧱11 (Brick) - decent probability
- 🏜️ (Desert) - no production

## Decision

After analyzing all options, Node 2 offers the best balance:
- Access to Wood(6) - high probability and essential for early expansion
- Access to Brick(11) - needed for roads and settlements
- Access to Ore(5) - essential for cities later
- Resource diversity across three different types
- Good future expansion potential

This settlement provides access to three crucial resources with one high-probability hex, setting up a strong foundation for both early expansion and later city upgrades.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 0 | Player: BLUE | Action: BUILD_INITIAL_ROAD

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. End turn to preserve resources
2. Hope for favorable dice rolls next turn
3. Based on future resources, prioritize building a settlement (if I get brick) or buying development cards (if I get ore)
4. Look for opportunities to interfere with RED's win condition
5. Only reveal my VP card when I can reach 10 VP
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.
  To adjust your plan, provide a NEW PLAN in your reasoning with <plan>your new plan</plan>

# Initial Placement Analysis - Building First Road

I need to choose the optimal placement for my first road from my initial settlement at node 2, which produces wood (6), ore (5), and brick (11). Since I'm in the initial placement phase, these roads are free (no cost).

## Road Options Analysis:
- [0] Road at edge (2, 3): Connects node 2 to node 3
- [1] Road at edge (2, 9): Connects node 2 to node 9
- [2] Road at edge (1, 2): Connects node 2 to node 1

Let me analyze each option based on where it leads:

### Option [0] - Road at edge (2, 3):
Looking at the resource grid, node 3 connects to:
- 🧱11 (Brick)
- ⛏️3 (Ore)
- 🌲6 (Wood)
This direction leads toward the center of the board and could provide access to node 4, connecting to more diverse resources.

### Option [1] - Road at edge (2, 9):
Node 9 connects to:
- 🌾5 (Wheat)
- 🧱11 (Brick)
- ⛏️5 (Ore)
This direction provides access to wheat, which I currently don't have, and maintains good ore access.

### Option [2] - Road at edge (1, 2):
Node 1 connects to:
- ⛏️5 (Ore)
- 🌲6 (Wood)
- 🐑8 (Sheep)
This gives access to sheep, which I don't currently have, with decent number probability (8).

## Strategic Considerations:
1. I need to diversify my resources - currently missing wheat and sheep
2. Need to aim toward strong expansion spots
3. Should consider future connectivity to valuable ports
4. Want to avoid dead ends or being boxed in

Looking at option [1], it gives me access to wheat (which I need) while staying connected to both ore and brick. The path would eventually lead toward the brick port (nodes 28, 29), which could be valuable since I'm on a brick hex.

Option [2] gives me access to sheep with a good number (8) and could eventually lead to the ore port (52, 53), which complements my ore hex.

Option [0] leads more toward the center but doesn't immediately add resource diversity.

<plan>
1. Build road toward node 9 to gain access to wheat
2. Aim for a second settlement that gives me access to sheep
3. Balance expansion and resource diversity early game
4. Target the brick port if production allows, as it complements my initial placement
</plan>

Given the importance of resource diversity and the need for wheat for city upgrades later, I'll choose option [1] to build a road at edge (2, 9).

# Initial Settlement Selection Analysis

I need to carefully analyze this critical decision as my second initial settlement will shape my entire game strategy.

## Game State Summary
- This is my initial settlement placement (second settlement)
- I already have one settlement at node 2, which produces:
  - 🌲 Wood (6) - Excellent production
  - ⛏️ Ore (5) - Good production
  - 🧱 Brick (11) - Fair production
- I currently lack 🌾 Wheat and 🐑 Sheep in my production
- RED has settlements at nodes 6 and 20, covering Ore, Sheep, Wood, and Wheat

## Settlement Evaluation Criteria
1. Resource diversity - need Wheat and/or Sheep
2. High probability numbers (6, 8, 5, 9)
3. Future expansion potential
4. Access to valuable ports
5. Position away from my first settlement (node 2) for better board coverage

## Top Settlement Options Analysis

### Option 10 - Node 17
- Resources: Brick (8), Sheep (2), Ore (3)
- Production value: Medium (8 is good, but 2 and 3 are poor)
- Gives me sheep (missing resource) but on a poor number (2)
- Good expansion potential

### Option 13 - Node 24
- Resources: Wood (10), Ore (5), Wood (9)
- Production value: Good (5 and 9 are solid)
- But no new resource types - already have wood and ore
- Near the 2:1 Ore port (nodes 52-53)

### Option 16 - Node 27
- Resources: Wood (10), Wheat (5), Brick (11)
- Good production value
- Gives me wheat (missing resource)
- Access to 2:1 Brick port (nodes 28-29)

### Option 21 - Node 32
- Resources: Desert (blocked), Wheat (11), Sheep (9)
- Good production value on Wheat and Sheep
- Gives me both missing resources
- Access to 2:1 Sheep port (32-33)
- Desert hex doesn't produce (and has robber)

## Best Option Analysis

Node 32 (option 21) stands out as the optimal choice because:
1. It gives me both missing resources (wheat and sheep)
2. Provides good number probabilities (9 and 11)
3. Access to the 2:1 Sheep port
4. Far from my first settlement for broader board coverage
5. Even though one hex is desert (with robber), the other two hexes compensate with solid production

<plan>
1. Establish second settlement at node 32 to gain access to wheat and sheep
2. Use 2:1 sheep port for efficient trading
3. Focus early expansion toward wheat production
4. Balance city upgrades (need ore/wheat) with expansion (need wood/brick)
5. Watch the robber movement - it currently blocks one of my settlement hexes
</plan>

Therefore, I choose option 21 (node 32).

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 2 | Player: BLUE | Action: BUILD_INITIAL_ROAD

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Establish second settlement at node 32 to gain access to wheat and sheep
2. Use 2:1 sheep port for efficient trading
3. Focus early expansion toward wheat production
4. Balance city upgrades (need ore/wheat) with expansion (need wood/brick)
5. Watch the robber movement - it currently blocks one of my settlement hexes
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.
  To adjust your plan, provide a NEW PLAN in your reasoning with <plan>your new plan</plan>

# Initial Settlement Analysis

Looking at my initial settlements:
- Settlement at node 2: Produces wood (6), ore (5), and brick (11). Good production values on wood and ore.
- Settlement at node 32: Currently only produces wheat (11), but is directly connected to the 2:1 sheep port.

# Road Building Options Analysis

I need to place my initial road from my second settlement at node 32. Let me analyze each option:

[0] Build road at edge (32, 33):
- Leads toward the 2:1 sheep port (already have access)
- Extends toward node 33, which connects to hex producing wheat (11) - already have this resource
- Limited expansion potential, as I'm heading toward the edge of the board

[1] Build road at edge (11, 32):
- Creates a connection between my two settlements
- Opens pathway toward the center of the board
- Could enable future expansion toward nodes 10, 12, 13

[2] Build road at edge (31, 32):
- Expands toward the desert hex (no production value)
- May open up path to node 30 (connects to wheat 5 hex) and node 29
- Potential pathway to brick port (nodes 28, 29)

# Strategic Considerations

1. Connecting my settlements ([1]) would create a foundation for longest road in the future
2. I currently lack sheep production, so expanding toward other hexes ([1] or [2]) would be valuable
3. The road should facilitate future settlement placement at high-value locations
4. I already have access to the sheep port, so [0] doesn't provide additional port access

Looking at potential future settlement locations:
- From [1]: Could reach node 13 (wheat 11, ore 3, sheep 9) - excellent resource diversity
- From [2]: Could reach nodes 30, 31 (wheat 5, desert) - less compelling

<plan>
1. Build a connection between my settlements to create foundation for potential longest road
2. Target node 13 for my next settlement to gain access to sheep and additional wheat/ore
3. Later expand toward more ore production to balance my resources
4. Use the 2:1 sheep port efficiently once I have sheep production
5. Watch the robber movement - it currently blocks one of my settlement hexes
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I'll choose option [1] - building a road at edge (11, 32). This creates a connection between my settlements and opens paths toward valuable expansion opportunities, particularly node 13.

3. Later expand toward more ore production to balance my resources
4. Use the 2:1 sheep port efficiently once I have sheep production
5. Watch the robber movement - it currently blocks one of my settlement hexes

❓ Select action by number (0-17):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the robber placement options carefully to determine the optimal move.

First, let's look at the current state:
- BLUE (me): 2 VP, 1 wheat, settlements at nodes 2 and 32
- RED: 2 VP, 1 unknown card, settlements at nodes 6 and 20
- The robber is currently on (0, -2, 2) which is a desert hex

My considerations for robber placement:

1) **Maximize impact on opponent**: I should prioritize blocking RED's most productive hexes
2) **Steal valuable resource**: I should target hexes where RED has settlements and might have resources I need
3) **Strategic blocking**: Block resources RED needs for their next build

Looking at RED's settlements:
- Node 6 produces: ⛏️5[⭐⭐], 🐑8[⭐⭐⭐], 🌲9[⭐⭐]
- Node 20 produces: 🐑6[⭐⭐⭐], 🐑8[⭐⭐⭐], 🌾3[⭐]

RED's strongest production is in sheep (🐑) with 8 being a high-probability number. RED also has access to wood (🌲) on a 9, which is fairly good.

Examining options where I can steal from RED while blocking key resources:
- [1]: Block ore (⛏️5) at (1, -1, 0) - This hurts RED's ore production
- [5]: Block sheep (🐑6) at (0, 1, -1) - This reduces RED's strong sheep production
- [6]: Block sheep (🐑8) at (1, 0, -1) - This is RED's best hex, producing for both settlements!
- [15]: Block wheat (🌾3) at (1, 1, -2) - Low probability hex, not very impactful
- [17]: Block wood (🌲9) at (2, -1, -1) - This is a good production hex for RED

Option [6] stands out clearly as the optimal choice because:
1. It blocks sheep (🐑8) - RED's most productive hex that supports BOTH settlements
2. It allows me to steal from RED
3. It targets a high-probability number (8), which is extremely valuable
4. Blocking sheep may slow down RED's ability to trade or build roads

<plan>
1. Continue building a connection between my settlements to create foundation for potential longest road
2. Target node 13 for my next settlement to gain access to sheep and additional wheat/ore
3. Focus on acquiring brick and wood for roads to connect my settlements and expand
4. Use the 2:1 sheep port once I establish sheep production
5. Watch RED's expansion strategy and be prepared to block if needed
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

RESPONSE:
# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to carefully analyze where to place the robber to maximize my advantage while hindering my opponent's progress.

## Step 1: Evaluate Red Player's Resource Production

RED has settlements that produce:
- 🐑8[⭐⭐⭐] (high probability) - 2 settlements access this
- 🐑6[⭐⭐⭐] (high probability) - 1 settlement
- 🌲9[⭐⭐] (medium probability) - 1 settlement
- ⛏️5[⭐⭐] (medium probability) - 1 settlement
- 🌾3[⭐] (low probability) - 1 settlement

RED seems to have good sheep production and a developing road network (longest: 3).

## Step 2: Analyze High-Value Targets

The most impactful robber placement would be on a hex that:
1. Blocks multiple settlements (especially opponent's)
2. Targets high-probability numbers
3. Affects resources the opponent needs for their strategy

Looking at RED's production, their sheep (🐑8) is particularly strong since it's accessed by both of their settlements. This is at location (1, 0, -1).

## Step 3: Consider My Own Production

I need to avoid blocking my own resources:
- 🌲6 (high value)
- ⛏️5 (medium value)
- 🧱11 (low value)
- 🌾11 (low value)

## Step 4: Determine Optimal Robber Placement

Option [5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) - This is the sheep 8 hex that produces for both of RED's settlements. This is a high-probability tile that's crucial for RED's production.

Other strong options:
- Option [0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) - This blocks wood 6 but would affect my own settlement.
- Option [4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) - This blocks RED's sheep 6 but only affects one settlement.

<plan>
1. Block RED's most productive resource (sheep) to slow their progress
2. Continue building a connection between my settlements to create foundation for potential longest road
3. Target node 13 for my next settlement to gain access to sheep and additional wheat/ore
4. Focus on acquiring brick and wood for roads to connect my settlements and expand
5. Use the 2:1 sheep port once I establish sheep production
</plan>

The most strategic move is to place the robber on the sheep 8 hex to disrupt RED's strongest resource production, which affects both their settlements. This will significantly slow RED's progress while I work on my expansion strategy.

- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

❓ Select action by number (0-17):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I need to analyze the current game state and determine the optimal robber placement to advance my strategy.

First, let's examine the current board state:
- I'm the BLUE player with 2 VP (2 settlements)
- RED player also has 2 VP (2 settlements)
- RED has built 4 roads and has a potential path to longest road
- I have 1 wood resource, RED has 1 hidden card
- The robber is on (1, 0, -1), which is a sheep hex with a dice roll of 8 (high probability)

Let's analyze RED's production:
- RED is strong in sheep production at nodes 6 and 20 (both connected to sheep tiles)
- RED has settlements on high-probability numbers: 8 (sheep), 6 (sheep), 9 (wood), 5 (ore)
- RED seems to be focusing on a road-building strategy (4 roads already built)

My objectives for robber placement should be:
1. Block RED's high-probability resources
2. Target resources that RED needs for expansion (likely wood and brick for roads)
3. Position myself to steal a useful resource

Looking at the options:
- Option [1] moves the robber to (1, -1, 0), which is an ore hex with a 5 value, and I can steal from RED. This blocks one of RED's important ore production.
- Option [5] moves the robber to (0, 1, -1), which is a sheep hex with a 6 value, and I can steal from RED. This blocks one of RED's high-probability sheep.
- Option [17] moves the robber to (2, -1, -1), which is a wood hex with a 9 value, and I can steal from RED. This blocks one of RED's wood production.

Of these, I think option [5] is most strategic because:
1. It blocks a high-probability (6) sheep hex that RED is producing from
2. Sheep seems to be RED's most abundant resource (two settlements on sheep)
3. I can steal a resource from RED
4. This could slow down RED's expansion

<plan>
1. Block RED's high-probability sheep production (6) to slow their progress
2. Continue building a connection between my settlements to create foundation for potential longest road
3. Target node 13 for my next settlement to gain access to sheep and additional wheat/ore
4. Focus on acquiring brick and wood for roads to connect my settlements and expand
5. Use the 2:1 sheep port once I establish sheep production
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I choose option 5 - move the robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

❓ Select action by number (0-17):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I need to analyze the best location for placing the robber to maximize my chances of winning while hindering my opponent.

First, let's understand the current game state:
- Both players have 2 VP (2 settlements each)
- RED has a longer road network (4 segments vs my 1)
- The robber is currently on a wood hex with value 6, which is high-probability
- I have 2 wood and 1 ore, while RED has 2 hidden resources

Looking at RED's production:
- Strong sheep production from two 8s and one 6
- Good wood production from a 9
- Decent ore production from a 5
- Some wheat from a 3

My production:
- Strong wood from a 6
- Good ore from a 5 
- Some brick from an 11
- Some wheat from an 11

Strategic considerations:
1. I should target RED's strongest production to slow them down
2. I should ideally steal a useful resource
3. I want to block a high-probability number (6 or 8)

Looking at the options:
- Option [5] lets me block a sheep hex with value 8 and steal from RED
- Option [15] lets me block a wheat hex with value 3 and steal from RED
- Option [17] lets me block a wood hex with value 9 and steal from RED
- Option [4] lets me block a sheep hex with value 6 and steal from RED
- Option [0] lets me block an ore hex with value 5 and steal from RED

Option [5] blocks an 8 value sheep hex which is connected to TWO of RED's settlements (nodes 6 and 20). This is optimal as it would significantly reduce RED's sheep production, which appears to be their strongest resource. Additionally, I get to steal a resource from them.

<plan>
1. Block RED's high-probability sheep production (8) to severely limit their resource generation
2. Continue building roads to connect my settlements for potential longest road
3. Target node 13 for my next settlement to gain access to sheep and additional wheat/ore
4. Focus on acquiring brick and wood for roads to expand my network
5. If I acquire sheep, use my 2:1 sheep port for efficient trading
</plan>

I'm choosing option [5] to move the robber to the sheep hex (1, 0, -1) with value 8 that produces for both of RED's settlements, and steal a resource from RED.

- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 36 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Block RED's high-probability sheep production (8) to severely limit their resource generation
2. Continue building roads to connect my settlements for potential longest road
3. Target node 13 for my next settlement to gain access to sheep and additional wheat/ore
4. Focus on acquiring brick and wood for roads to expand my network
5. If I acquire sheep, use my 2:1 sheep port for efficient trading

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and my available options:

## Current Position
- I (BLUE) have 2 VP from two settlements
- I have 2 wood and 4 ore as resources
- My settlements are at node 2 (produces wood 6, ore 5, brick 11) and node 32 (produces wheat 11)
- The robber is on the wood 6 hex (0,0,0), blocking my best production
- RED has 2 settlements, 7 hidden resources, and a growing road network (5 roads with longest at 4)

## Available Actions
0. End turn
1-4. Maritime trades, giving 4 ore for wheat/brick/sheep/wood respectively (4:1 standard rate)

## Resource Analysis
- I have plenty of ore (4) but no wheat, brick, or sheep
- My wood production is currently blocked by the robber
- I can't build anything with my current resources - no settlements (need wood/brick/wheat/sheep), no cities (need ore/wheat), no roads (need wood/brick)

## Strategic Considerations:
1. **Road Building**: I can't build roads due to lacking brick
2. **Settlement Building**: Not possible without wood, brick, wheat and sheep
3. **City Upgrades**: Not possible without wheat
4. **Development Cards**: Not possible without sheep and wheat
5. **Trading**: I could trade 4 ore for a resource, but at a very inefficient 4:1 rate

<plan>
1. Trade for a resource that helps me most immediately - likely brick or wheat
2. On future turns, focus on moving the robber off my wood hex to restore my wood production
3. Continue building roads to connect my settlements for potential longest road
4. Target high-probability nodes for my next settlement, especially those with sheep access
5. Leverage my 2:1 sheep port once I acquire sheep resources
</plan>

## Decision Analysis
Since I can't build anything with my current resources, I need to consider trading. The 4:1 rate is inefficient but necessary:

- Trading for brick would help with roads, but I also need wood which is currently blocked
- Trading for wheat would help with either settlements or future city upgrades
- Trading for sheep would help with settlements or development cards
- Trading for wood seems redundant since I should eventually get wood when the robber moves

Given that wheat is useful for both settlements and cities, and I'm already producing it on an 11 (but that's low probability), getting wheat seems most versatile.

## Final Decision
I'll trade 4 ore for 1 wheat, which gives me the most flexibility for future turns.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available

❓ Select action by number (0-17):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I need to analyze where to move the robber to maximize my strategic position while hindering my opponent.

First, let me assess our current positions:
- I have 2 VP (2 settlements)
- RED also has 2 VP (2 settlements) but has 5 roads vs my 2, putting them ahead for longest road
- RED has 7 resource cards (at risk of losing to the robber)
- I only have 3 resources (2 wood, 1 wheat)
- The robber is currently on a brick hex (0, -1, 1), which is connected to my settlement at node 2

Let me evaluate the options for robber placement:

1) Target RED's high-probability hexes:
   - Tile (1, 0, -1): Sheep 8 [⭐⭐⭐] - This affects both RED settlements
   - Tile (2, -1, -1): Wood 9 [⭐⭐] - Connected to RED's settlement at node 6
   - Tile (0, 1, -1): Sheep 6 [⭐⭐⭐] - Connected to RED's settlement at node 20

2) Protect my own resources:
   - Moving the robber off (0, -1, 1) will restore brick production
   - But my best hex is Wood 6, which is not currently blocked

3) Steal opportunities:
   - RED has 7 cards, which gives me a good chance of getting something useful

After analysis, I should target RED's highest-producing hex while also stealing a resource. The sheep 8 tile (1, 0, -1) is connected to both of RED's settlements, so blocking this would significantly hinder their production while allowing me to steal a resource.

<plan>
1. Move robber to sheep 8 tile (1, 0, -1) to block RED's double sheep production and steal a resource
2. Use my wood and wheat plus whatever I steal to trade for brick if possible
3. Continue building roads toward viable settlement locations
4. Target a settlement that gives me access to ore or sheep that I'm currently missing
5. Consider leveraging my 2:1 sheep port once I secure sheep production
</plan>

The optimal action is to move the robber to tile (1, 0, -1), which is action number 5.

- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 48 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Move robber to sheep 8 tile (1, 0, -1) to block RED's double sheep production and steal a resource
2. Use my wood and wheat plus whatever I steal to trade for brick if possible
3. Continue building roads toward viable settlement locations
4. Target a settlement that gives me access to ore or sheep that I'm currently missing
5. Consider leveraging my 2:1 sheep port once I secure sheep production

# Game Analysis: Settlers of Catan Turn 48

Let me analyze the current game state and available options to determine the optimal move.

## Current Game Status
- I'm playing BLUE with 2 VP (from 2 settlements)
- I have resources: 2 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Sheep, 2 Wheat
- RED player has 2 VP and 7 hidden resources
- Robber is on the sheep 8 hex (1, 0, -1), which is already blocking a high-production hex for RED

## Resource Production Assessment
- My settlement at node 2 produces from three hexes: Wood 6 (high value), Ore 5 (medium), Brick 11 (low)
- My settlement at node 32 produces only from Wheat 11 (low value)
- I currently lack consistent Sheep and Ore production
- I have access to a 2:1 Sheep port at node 32-33

## Available Actions
My main option is to build a road, as I have the necessary resources (1 Wood, 1 Brick). I need to determine which road placement gives me the best strategic advantage.

## Road Placement Analysis
Looking at potential road placements:
1. Edge (9, 10): Extends toward the brick 11 hex
2. Edge (1, 2): Already have a road here (seems like a duplicate option)
3. Edge (10, 11): Extends toward my wheat-producing settlement
4. Edge (32, 33): Connects to my sheep port
5. Edge (31, 32): Extends from my wheat settlement in another direction
6. Edge (2, 3): Extends from my productive settlement
7. Edge (11, 12): Extends toward the wheat 11 / brick 11 intersection
8. Edge (8, 9): Extends toward the ore 5 hex

## Strategic Considerations
1. I need to improve my resource diversity
2. I should aim toward potential settlement locations
3. I should consider blocking RED's expansion
4. I need to improve my position for the longest road

## Evaluating Settlement Potential
Looking at where each road might lead me:
- Road (32, 33) gives direct access to my 2:1 sheep port
- Road (6, 2, 3) would head toward wheat/brick/ore
- Road (8, 9) would head toward the ore 5 hex
- Road (9, 10) would extend toward brick 11

<plan>
1. Build a road at edge (32, 33) to connect to my sheep port
2. Next turn, try to secure sheep production through trades or development cards
3. Target expansion toward ore production
4. Use the sheep port once I secure sheep production
5. Continue building roads toward viable settlement locations that give me ore and sheep
</plan>

After analyzing the options, connecting to the sheep port (edge 32, 33) provides immediate access to better trading capabilities when I acquire sheep resources. This is particularly valuable since one of my settlements only produces wheat, and having the port will give me more flexibility.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible

- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

# Game Analysis for Turn 50

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 2 VP from 2 settlements
- My resources: 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Sheep, 3 Wheat, 1 Ore
- I have access to a 2:1 Sheep port at nodes 32-33
- The robber is on the Sheep 8 hex, blocking a good production hex
- RED has 2 VP and 8 hidden resource cards, with a road network of 5 (longest: 4)
- My settlements produce Wood (6), Brick (11), Ore (5), and Wheat (11)
- I lack good Sheep production

## Strategic Priorities
Looking at my current situation, I need to:
1. Expand my road network toward promising settlement locations
2. Secure better resource diversity (especially sheep)
3. Build toward a long-term victory path

## Action Options Analysis
Let me analyze my available actions:

**Option 0: End Turn**
This wastes resources I could use to advance my position.

**Options 1-8: Build Roads**
Let me evaluate each road by considering where it leads and future expansion potential:

- Option 8 (Road at 33-34): Builds from my sheep port toward the sheep 9 hex, which would help address my sheep shortage.
- Option 4 (Road at 31-32): Connects to my settlement but leads toward the desert, not optimal.
- Options 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7: Connect around my settlement at node 2, offering various directions for expansion.

**Option 9: Buy Development Card**
This would cost my only sheep, wheat, and ore resources. While development cards can be valuable, I need to prioritize expansion right now.

## Strategic Decision
Road building is my priority to enable settlement expansion. Among the options, building toward sheep production makes the most sense given my resource needs. Road 33-34 leads toward a sheep 9 hex, which would complement my resource mix well and leverage my sheep port.

<plan>
1. Build a road at edge (33, 34) to expand toward the sheep 9 hex
2. Continue expanding toward potential settlement locations near sheep and ore production
3. Use my sheep port once I secure sheep production
4. Target upgrading settlements to cities once I have sufficient ore and wheat
5. Consider development cards in future turns after securing better resource production
</plan>

Based on my analysis, the best action is to build a road at edge (33, 34), which continues my expansion toward valuable sheep resources.

4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 50 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build a road at edge (33, 34) to expand toward the sheep 9 hex
2. Continue expanding toward potential settlement locations near sheep and ore production
3. Use my sheep port once I secure sheep production
4. Target upgrading settlements to cities once I have sufficient ore and wheat
5. Consider development cards in future turns after securing better resource production

# Game Analysis for Turn 50

Let me carefully analyze my current situation and available actions.

## Current Game State
- I have 2 VP from my 2 settlements
- Resources: 1 🐑SHEEP, 3 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE
- I have access to a 2:1 sheep port, but limited sheep production
- The robber is on the sheep 8 hex, blocking production there
- Both Red and I have 2 VP, but Red has 8 hidden resource cards

## Available Actions
I only have two options:
1. Buy a development card (costs 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE)
2. End my turn

## Action Analysis

**Option 1: Buy a development card**
Pros:
- Could get a Victory Point card (immediate hidden progress)
- Could get a Knight to move the robber and potentially gain largest army later
- Could get a Road Building, Year of Plenty, or Monopoly card for strategic advantage
- Uses up my resources before potential 7 roll that could make me discard
- Reduces my visible threat level while potentially advancing my position

Cons:
- Random outcome, might not get what I need most
- Uses my only ore, which I need for city upgrades

**Option 0: End Turn**
Pros:
- Save resources for next turn's builds
- Maintain flexibility

Cons:
- Risk losing cards if a 7 is rolled
- Not making any progress this turn

## Strategic Considerations
Looking at my current plan, I was focusing on expanding toward sheep production. However, I don't currently have the resources to build more roads or settlements. I also notice that Red has 8 hidden cards, which means they're potentially close to making significant moves.

A development card could be very valuable at this stage. A Victory Point would get me closer to winning without being visible to my opponent. A Knight would let me move the robber off the sheep 8 hex, potentially hurting Red's resource production while improving my future trades using my sheep port.

<plan>
1. Buy development cards for potential knights and hidden VP
2. When possible, continue expanding toward the sheep 9 hex for better resource diversity
3. Use the sheep port once I secure sheep production
4. Target upgrading settlements to cities once I have sufficient ore and wheat
5. Monitor Red's expansion and use robber strategically to slow their progress
</plan>

Given the limited options and the potential value of a development card at this stage, I believe purchasing a development card is the optimal move.

# Game Analysis for Turn 52

Let me analyze my current situation in this game of Settlers of Catan.

## Current Game State
- I have 2 Victory Points (2 settlements)
- Resources: 1 Wood, 2 Wheat
- I have 1 Knight development card in hand
- Red has 2 Victory Points and 9 hidden resource cards
- The robber is on the sheep 8 hex (1,0,-1), which is one of Red's high-production hexes

## Available Actions
0. Play Knight card - Move robber and steal a resource
1. Roll the dice

## Decision Analysis

Let me consider the pros and cons of each option:

### Option 0: Play Knight
**Pros:**
- Can remove the robber from the sheep 8 hex and place it on another high-value hex of Red's
- Could steal one of Red's 9 resources
- Moves me toward "Largest Army" (need 3 knights)
- Protects me from potential resource loss if I roll a 7

**Cons:**
- Playing the Knight now means I won't have it for defense later if the robber is placed on one of my hexes
- With only 3 resources, I don't risk losing cards if I roll a 7
- May be better to save this knight for a more critical moment

### Option 1: Roll Dice
**Pros:**
- I could gain more resources which I need for development
- I currently have few resources (only 3 total), so risking a roll of 7 isn't too dangerous
- Saving the Knight for a more strategic moment later when I have more resources or when Red is closer to winning

**Cons:**
- If I roll a 7, I won't gain any resources this turn
- Red has 9 resources and would likely have to discard if a 7 is rolled, but I wouldn't benefit directly from this since I'd be moving the robber

## Strategic Considerations
- I need more resources to execute my plan of buying development cards and expanding
- Red has a lot of resources (9) and might be planning a significant build
- Playing a Knight now could disrupt Red's plans before they can use those resources

<plan>
1. Continue focusing on development cards when possible
2. Expand toward better resource diversity, particularly targeting sheep production
3. Use my Knight card more strategically - either to protect a large hand or to disrupt Red at a critical moment
4. Work toward upgrading settlements to cities once I secure more ore production
5. Consider blocking Red's expansion with strategic road placement
</plan>

I believe the most strategic move is to roll the dice. With only 3 resources currently, I need to build my resource base before taking action. I should save my Knight card for a more critical moment, such as when I have a large hand to protect or when Red is closer to making a significant play.

- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 52 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Continue focusing on development cards when possible
2. Expand toward better resource diversity, particularly targeting sheep production
3. Use my Knight card more strategically - either to protect a large hand or to disrupt Red at a critical moment
4. Work toward upgrading settlements to cities once I secure more ore production
5. Consider blocking Red's expansion with strategic road placement

# Game Analysis for Turn 52

Let me analyze the current game state and available actions to determine the best strategic move.

## Current Situation Assessment

- **My Resources**: 1 🌲 Wood, 1 🧱 Brick, 3 🌾 Wheat, 1 Knight card
- **VP Status**: I have 2 VPs, Red has 2 VPs - we're tied
- **Board Position**: 
  - My settlements are at nodes 2 (producing Wood, Ore, Brick) and 32 (producing Wheat)
  - Red has settlements at nodes 6 (Ore, Sheep, Wood) and 20 (Sheep, Sheep, Wheat)
  - Red has 9 hidden resource cards and 5 roads (longest: 4)
- **Robber**: Currently on (1, 0, -1), a Sheep hex with 8 probability - this is blocking Red's high-value hex
- **Important Note**: Red has 9 resource cards - they're vulnerable to the robber on their next roll of 7

## Analysis of Available Actions

1. **Play Knight** (Action 0):
   - The robber is already on one of Red's best hexes (Sheep-8)
   - Could move it to another high-value hex for Red (possibly Wood-9 or Ore-5)
   - Would steal one of Red's 9 cards and prevent them from using all resources
   - Would start my path toward Largest Army (2 VP)

2. **Build Road** (Actions 2-10):
   - I only have 1 Wood and 1 Brick, so I can build exactly one road
   - This would use all my Wood/Brick resources, limiting flexibility
   - Need to determine which road best advances my position

3. **End Turn** (Action 1):
   - Keep my resources for a future turn
   - But this doesn't advance my position at all

## Road Build Analysis

Looking at the road options:
- Roads near node 2 (my settlement): (1,2), (2,3), (2,9)
- Roads near node 32 (my settlement): (31,32), (34,35), (13,34)
- Other connecting roads: (9,10), (10,11), (11,12), (8,9)

Most strategic road would:
1. Lead toward future settlement locations
2. Block Red's expansion
3. Build toward resources I need (especially Sheep which I don't have)

Looking at node connectivity and future settlement possibilities:
- Edge (34,35) looks promising as it builds toward the Wood port and Sheep resources
- Edge (9,10) could expand toward the Brick port area
- Edge (2,3) or (11,12) would build toward the center of the board

## Strategic Decision

Since the robber is already on one of Red's best hexes (Sheep-8), playing the Knight doesn't provide immediate benefit. Red has 9 cards, making them vulnerable to a 7 roll, so I should save my Knight for when it's more advantageous.

Building a road makes more sense for long-term position. Looking at edge (34,35), it builds toward:
1. The 2:1 Wood port
2. Sheep production (which I currently lack)
3. A path that Red hasn't blocked yet

<plan>
1. Build strategically to expand toward sheep resources and 2:1 wood port
2. Save Knight card for when Red gets more resources or when robber blocks my production
3. Focus on gaining enough resources to build a settlement at a sheep-producing hex
4. Continue development card strategy when I gain more ore and wheat
5. Consider cities once I have better resource diversity and production
</plan>

After careful analysis, I choose to build a road at edge (34,35) to expand toward sheep resources and the wood port.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position

# Analyzing Catan Game State and Options

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 2 VP from my 2 settlements (nodes 2 and 32)
- I have 3 wheat resources and 1 Knight development card
- Robber is on a sheep hex (1,0,-1) which produces on an 8 (high probability)
- Red player has 9 cards in hand (risk of losing half if a 7 is rolled)
- Both players are tied at 2 VP with equal road and settlement count

## Analyzing My Options
Option 0: Play Knight Card
- Benefits:
  - Move robber from the sheep hex where it's blocking a high-probability spot
  - Steal one of Red's 9 resources (high chance of getting something useful)
  - Make progress toward Largest Army (2 VP)
  - Remove robber from a hex that's productive for Red player
  - Red has settlements at nodes 6 and 20, both producing sheep on that 8 hex

Option 1: End Turn
- Keep Knight card for future use
- Risk that Red will use their 9 cards to make significant progress next turn

## Strategic Considerations
1. Resource analysis:
   - I'm currently low on resources (only 3 wheat)
   - Red has many resources (9 cards) which they could use for major builds
   - Playing Knight now could disrupt Red's next turn by stealing a resource

2. Knight timing:
   - Playing Knight now gives immediate advantage by disrupting Red's large hand
   - Saving Knight might be valuable if I'm threatened with a robber later
   - But with Red having 9 cards, this is a high-impact moment to play the Knight

3. Board position:
   - The robber is blocking a highly productive sheep hex (8)
   - This hex produces for Red at two settlements (nodes 6 and 20)
   - Moving the robber would likely hurt Red's production significantly

<plan>
1. Play Knight to disrupt Red's large hand and steal a resource
2. Move robber to another productive hex for Red (possibly 🌲9 at (2,-1,-1))
3. Continue expanding toward sheep resources once I gain more resources
4. Work toward development cards when ore becomes available
5. Focus on upgrading to cities when I have reliable ore and wheat production
</plan>

Given Red's large hand size (9 cards) and the opportunity to steal a resource while disrupting their production, playing the Knight card is the optimal strategic move at this time.

2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 52 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Play Knight to disrupt Red's large hand and steal a resource
2. Move robber to another productive hex for Red (possibly 🌲9 at (2,-1,-1))
3. Continue expanding toward sheep resources once I gain more resources
4. Work toward development cards when ore becomes available
5. Focus on upgrading to cities when I have reliable ore and wheat production

# Analyzing Move Robber Options

I need to analyze the best hex to place the robber to disrupt my opponent (RED) while maximizing my own position.

## Evaluating RED's Settlements
Red has settlements at:
- Node 6: Produces ⛏️5[⭐⭐], 🐑8[⭐⭐⭐], 🌲9[⭐⭐]
- Node 20: Produces 🐑6[⭐⭐⭐], 🐑8[⭐⭐⭐], 🌾3[⭐]

## Red's Most Valuable Hexes
1. 🐑8 at (1,0,-1) - Currently has robber, connected to BOTH of Red's settlements
2. 🐑6 at (0,1,-1) - Connected to one of Red's settlements
3. 🌲9 at (2,-1,-1) - Connected to one of Red's settlements
4. ⛏️5 at (1,-1,0) - Connected to one of Red's settlements

## Viable Options with Stealing
The most impactful options that allow me to steal from RED are:
- [1] Move robber to (1,-1,0) [⛏️5] and steal from RED
- [5] Move robber to (0,1,-1) [🐑6] and steal from RED  
- [15] Move robber to (1,1,-2) [🌾3] and steal from RED
- [17] Move robber to (2,-1,-1) [🌲9] and steal from RED

## Strategic Analysis

Looking at these options:
1. Option [1] blocks ⛏️5, which hurts both RED and myself as my settlement at node 2 produces from this hex
2. Option [5] blocks 🐑6, which is a high-probability hex that RED uses heavily
3. Option [15] blocks 🌾3, which is low probability (3) and less impactful
4. Option [17] blocks 🌲9, which is a good probability resource RED uses

Considering RED has 9 cards, they likely have a strong hand. Blocking their wood production at the 🌲9 hex would:
1. Prevent them from building additional roads and expanding
2. Allow me to steal a resource
3. Not hurt my own production as I don't have settlements on this hex

<plan>
1. Move robber to 🌲9 at (2,-1,-1) to disrupt RED's wood production
2. Focus on collecting resources for a new settlement 
3. Target acquiring ore for development cards and future city upgrades
4. Consider building toward the 2:1 ore port at nodes 52,53 for better resource management
5. Continue saving wheat for development cards and city upgrades
</plan>

Option [17] is optimal as it blocks a productive hex for RED without affecting my own production, and allows me to steal a resource from RED's large hand.

**End Turn [0]**
Not optimal as I can make progress this turn.

**Road Building [1-9]**
I have exactly enough resources (1 Wood, 1 Brick) to build one road. Let's analyze the strategic road placements:
- The most useful roads would be ones that extend toward potential settlement locations or help secure longest road.

**Settlement Building [10-11]**
- Option [10]: Build at node 34 (connects to 🌾11, 🐑9, 🧱10)
- Option [11]: Build at node 35 (connects to 🐑9, 🧱10 and the 2:1 wood port)

Both settlement options would immediately add 1 VP, bringing me to 3/10. I have all required resources (1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Sheep, 4 Wheat).

**Maritime Trade [12-15]**
Trading 4 Wheat for another resource wouldn't be efficient at this point since I'd still lack resources for more valuable builds.

## Strategic Considerations

1. **VP Race**: RED is at 4 VP with longest road. Building a settlement now would put me at 3 VP.

2. **Settlement Value Comparison**:
   - Node 34: Produces on 🌾11[⭐], 🐑9[⭐⭐], 🧱10[⭐], connecting to sheep port
   - Node 35: Produces on 🐑9[⭐⭐], 🧱10[⭐] and connects to 2:1 wood port

3. **Future Position**: 
   - Node 34 has better resource diversity (wheat, sheep, brick)
   - Node 35 connects to the 2:1 wood port which could be valuable

4. **Resource Production**: I need to improve my production, especially for ore which I currently don't produce at all.

## Decision

Building a settlement is clearly the optimal move as it directly increases my victory points. Between nodes 34 and 35, node 34 offers better resource diversity with wheat (11), sheep (9), and brick (10). While node 35 connects to the 2:1 wood port, node 34's wheat production is more valuable for my long-term strategy of getting development cards and city upgrades.

<plan>
1. Build settlement at node 34 to gain vital wheat, sheep and brick production
2. Next, work toward gathering ore for development cards and cities
3. Continue expanding toward ore-producing hexes
4. Consider securing longest road if opportunity arises (I'm only 1 road behind RED)
</plan>

The optimal action is to build a settlement at node 34:

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis

Let me carefully assess the current state of the game and my options.

## Game State Assessment
- I have 3 VP from my 3 settlements
- Red has 4 VP (2 settlements + 2 VP for longest road)
- I have 2 wood, 2 sheep, and 2 wheat resources
- I need to focus on gaining VP to catch up to Red

## My Current Position
- My settlements are at nodes 2, 32, and 34
- I already have access to the 2:1 sheep port (nodes 32, 33)
- I'm producing wood (6), ore (5), brick (11), wheat (11), and sheep (9)
- The robber is on the wood (6) hex, which is unfortunate as it's my best wood production tile

## Available Actions Analysis
My options are:
- [0] End turn
- [1-4] Various port trades (using my 2:1 sheep port)

Since I don't have any builds available with my current resources, the options are either to end my turn or to trade. Looking at my resources, I have:
- 2 wood, 2 sheep, 2 wheat (no brick or ore)
- I could trade sheep at my 2:1 port for other resources

## Strategic Options

Looking at what I could aim for with trades:
1. **City upgrade** would require 3 ore + 2 wheat (I have 0 ore, 2 wheat)
2. **New settlement** would require 1 wood + 1 brick + 1 sheep + 1 wheat (I have 2 wood, 0 brick, 2 sheep, 2 wheat)
3. **Development card** would require 1 ore + 1 sheep + 1 wheat (I have 0 ore, 2 sheep, 2 wheat)
4. **Road building** would require 1 wood + 1 brick per road (I have 2 wood, 0 brick)

The most realistic near-term goal is building either roads or a settlement, but I'm missing brick. If I trade 2 sheep for 1 brick, I'd have enough for a road. This would help me work toward potentially contesting the longest road bonus.

<plan>
1. Trade port: Give 2 sheep for 1 brick
2. Build a road strategically to work toward longest road
3. Focus on getting more brick and ore for future builds
4. Consider challenging RED for longest road (they have 6 segments, I have 4)
5. Look for opportunities to build another settlement at a high-value location
</plan>

I believe the best option now is to trade 2 sheep for 1 brick using my port, which will allow me to build a road on my next turn when I get resources.

# Game Analysis for Catan

Let me analyze the current game state and available options:

## Current Game Status
- I'm BLUE with 3 VP from 3 settlements
- RED has 4 VP (2 settlements + longest road)
- I have 2 wood, 1 brick, 2 wheat resources
- I have access to the 2:1 sheep port
- My longest road is 4 segments, RED's is 6 segments

## Resource Assessment
I have exactly enough wood (2) and brick (1) to build one road. I need to consider the most strategic road placement.

## Road Options Analysis
Let me analyze each potential road placement:

1. Edge (9, 10): Would this extend my longest road? Looking at the node connectivity, this could potentially connect to my network but without seeing the full road network it's hard to be certain.

2. Edge (1, 2): This connects to my settlement at node 2, which is a productive settlement (6-wood, 5-ore, 11-brick).

3. Edge (10, 11): This might extend toward my settlement at node 11, potentially creating a longer road segment.

4. Edge (35, 36): This connects to the 2:1 wood port, but I don't have excess wood to trade.

5. Edge (31, 32): This connects to my settlement at node 32.

6. Edge (2, 3): This extends from my settlement at node 2.

7. Edge (11, 12): This connects nodes 11 and 12, potentially extending my road network.

8. Edge (8, 9): This connects nodes 8 and 9, potentially extending toward valuable resources.

9. Edge (13, 34): This connects my settlements at nodes 13 and 34, which could be strategic for creating a road network.

## Strategic Considerations
1. My current plan mentions focusing on longest road - I should prioritize roads that extend my current longest segment
2. RED has 6 segments to my 4, so I need to add more roads strategically to overtake them
3. I should also consider roads that lead to potential new settlement spots with good resources
4. Without seeing the full road network, I need to identify which option best extends my current longest path

<plan>
1. Build a road that extends my longest road segment (current best guess is option 2, 3, 6, or 7)
2. Continue trading through the sheep port to get more brick
3. Focus on challenging RED for longest road (need 3+ more road segments)
4. Look for opportunities to build settlements at high-value locations
5. Save wheat for eventual city upgrades once I secure more ore
</plan>

Based on the information available, I believe option 3 (road at edge 10, 11) is most likely to extend my longest road segment. This appears to connect nodes that would continue my existing road network and work toward the longest road bonus.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Analysis of Robber Placement Options

I need to move the robber strategically to both hinder my opponent RED (who is at 6 VP versus my 3 VP) and potentially gain resources through stealing.

## Game Situation Assessment
- RED is leading with 6 VP to my 3 VP
- RED has longest road (6 segments vs my 5)
- RED has 1 city and 2 settlements (producing various resources)
- I have 3 settlements but no cities
- The robber is currently on hex (0,0,0) which is a Wood 6 (high-probability) that I produce from

## Robber Placement Priorities
1. Target RED's high-probability resource production
2. Steal a resource from RED that would help my strategy
3. Block resources that RED needs for their next likely build

Looking at RED's buildings:
- City at node 6: Produces ore-5, sheep-8, wood-9
- Settlement at node 20: Produces sheep-6, sheep-8, wheat-3
- Settlement at node 17: Produces sheep-2, brick-10, brick-8

RED has strong sheep and brick production. Notably, they have sheep-8 (high probability) in two locations.

## Best Options Analysis:
- Option [5] - Move to (1,0,-1) Sheep-8 hex: This blocks a high-probability sheep hex that RED produces from TWICE (both at nodes 6 and 20). This is very impactful.
- Option [17] - Move to (2,-1,-1) Wood-9: Blocks RED's city production of wood.
- Option [12] - Move to (-2,2,0) Brick-8: Blocks RED's settlement production of high-probability brick.

<plan>
1. Block RED's high-probability sheep production to slow their road building
2. Try to catch up on road building to challenge for longest road
3. Trade my sheep through port to get more brick
4. Build settlements at strategic locations to increase production
5. Save wheat for future city upgrades when I secure more ore
</plan>

The most impactful move is option [5], which blocks the sheep-8 hex that RED produces from twice (at their city and a settlement). This significantly reduces their resource income and slows their progress, while I can steal a resource from them that might help my road-building efforts.

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze my current position and available options thoroughly:

## Current Game State
- I (BLUE) have 3 VP from 3 settlements
- RED has 6 VP (2 from settlements, 2 from city, 2 from longest road)
- I'm 3 VP behind and need to catch up quickly
- Resources: 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 2 Sheep, 4 Wheat
- RED has longest road with 6 segments (I have 5)

## Resource Production Analysis
- I have decent wood (6) and some brick (11), but both are lower probability
- I have decent sheep (9) and wheat (11) production
- I lack ore production, which I'll need for cities and development cards
- The robber is currently on a sheep hex (1,0,-1) that benefits RED

## Available Options

### 1. Build a Settlement at node 10
- This would cost 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Wheat, 1 Sheep (all resources I have)
- Node 10 connects:
  - Desert (no production)
  - Wheat 5 (good number)
  - Brick 11 (poor number)
- Benefits:
  - Immediate +1 VP
  - Additional resource production
  - Near Brick port (nodes 28-29)

### 2. Build a Road
- Would use all my wood and brick
- Could extend toward potential settlement locations
- Could work toward contesting longest road

### 3. Maritime Trade
- I could trade for ore or more wood/brick
- Not ideal use of resources right now when I can build

## Strategic Assessment

RED is 3 points ahead at 6 VP with longest road. I need to make progress toward catching up.

Building a settlement at node 10 provides:
1. Immediate +1 VP (reducing gap to 2 VP)
2. Increased resource production
3. Position near a port (brick 2:1)

This is more valuable than extending my road network at this point, especially since I don't have enough resources to build multiple roads to challenge longest road yet.

<plan>
1. Build settlement at node 10 to gain VP and increase production
2. Focus on acquiring ore (through trades or expansion) to upgrade settlements to cities
3. Continue extending road network strategically when resources allow
4. Consider development cards if I can acquire ore efficiently
</plan>

The optimal move is to build a settlement at node 10, which gives immediate VP progress and positions me well for future turns.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Analyzing Robber Placement Options

I need to evaluate the best hex to place the robber to maximize my chances of winning. Let me analyze the current game state:

## Game Status Assessment
- I (BLUE) have 4 VP with 4 settlements
- RED has 6 VP (including 2 VP for longest road), 2 settlements and 1 city
- RED is ahead by 2 VP, making them the biggest threat
- I have 1 wood, 1 sheep, 3 wheat, but no brick or ore

## Robber Placement Strategy
When placing the robber, I should consider:
1. Targeting high-probability hexes (6 or 8) that RED depends on
2. Targeting resources that RED needs and I don't need as much
3. Stealing a useful resource from RED when possible

## Analyzing RED's Production
RED has production on:
- 🏙️ at node 6: ⛏️5, 🐑8, 🌲9 (high-value city with 8 sheep)
- 🏠 at node 20: 🐑6, 🐑8, 🌾3 (produces sheep from 6 and 8)
- 🏠 at node 17: 🐑2, 🧱10, 🧱8 (produces brick from 8)

RED has excellent sheep production from two high-probability rolls (6 and 8) and good brick production from an 8.

## Evaluating Options
Looking at RED's most valuable hexes:
- 🐑8 at (1, 0, -1) - Currently has the robber
- 🐑6 at (0, 1, -1) - Option [5] - High sheep production
- 🧱8 at (-2, 2, 0) - Option [12] - High brick production

Stealing potential:
- RED only has 2 cards, but they could be valuable resources

Looking at my needs: I need brick and ore the most to build roads and upgrade settlements.

## Decision
The best options are:
1. Option [5]: Move robber to (0, 1, -1) - This blocks RED's 6-sheep production and lets me steal a card
2. Option [12]: Move robber to (-2, 2, 0) - This blocks RED's 8-brick production and lets me steal a card

I think option [12] is slightly better because:
- It blocks an 8 (higher probability than 6)
- It blocks brick which RED needs for roads to maintain longest road
- I also need brick for my own expansion
- RED has two settlements producing sheep, but only one producing brick
- Blocking their brick production will slow their expansion more effectively

<plan>
1. Block RED's brick production to slow their expansion
2. Look to trade for ore and brick to build roads toward resource diversification
3. Consider upgrading settlements to cities once I have ore production
4. Try to challenge RED for longest road to take away their 2 VP bonus
</plan>

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

I'll analyze my options carefully to determine the optimal move for this turn.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 4 VP from my 4 settlements
- RED has 6 VP (3 VP from buildings + 2 VP from longest road)
- I have 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 sheep, and 3 wheat
- I can potentially build one road this turn with my wood and brick

## Strategic Considerations

### Road Building Options Analysis
Let me evaluate each road building option:

1. Edge (9, 10): Extends toward the wheat port (nodes 28, 29), but doesn't immediately increase my longest road.
2. Edge (1, 2): Connects toward ore and wood resources, potentially setting up for future settlement.
3. Edge (35, 36): Extends toward the wood port.
4. Edge (31, 32): Connects toward the sheep port I already have access to.
5. Edge (2, 3): Extends toward brick/ore resources.
6. Edge (11, 12): Connects toward wheat resources.
7. Edge (8, 9): Extends toward ore resources.
8. Edge (10, 29): Extends toward the wheat port.
9. Edge (13, 34): Connects two of my settlements but doesn't offer expansion potential.

### Victory Path Analysis
- RED is 4 points ahead of me with 6 VP vs my 4 VP
- RED has longest road (2 VP) - if I can take this, I could shift the balance
- I need ore production to upgrade settlements to cities, which is critical for efficient VP gain
- I lack ore production in my current settlements

### Resource Production Assessment
My current weaknesses:
- No ore production (critical for city upgrades)
- Limited brick production (needed for expansion)

<plan>
1. Build a road toward ore production areas to enable settlement building near ore
2. Work toward challenging RED for longest road (need 7+ connected roads)
3. Once I have ore access, focus on upgrading settlements to cities
4. Maintain resource diversity through strategic settlement placement
</plan>

## Decision Making
Based on my analysis, I need to prioritize road building that:
1. Helps me gain access to ore production
2. Sets up for potential longest road competition
3. Creates paths for new settlement locations

Looking at the available options, edge (1, 2) connects toward ore and wood resources, which aligns with my need for ore production. This appears to be the most strategically valuable move as it sets me up for future expansion toward resources I'm currently lacking.

My final action choice is:

\boxed{2}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 88 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build a road toward ore production areas to enable settlement building near ore
2. Work toward challenging RED for longest road (need 7+ connected roads)
3. Once I have ore access, focus on upgrading settlements to cities
4. Maintain resource diversity through strategic settlement placement

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action.

## Current Game Status
- BLUE (me): 4/10 victory points (4 settlements)
- RED: 6/10 victory points (2 settlements, 1 city, longest road +2 VP)
- My resources: 1 WOOD, 2 SHEEP, 2 WHEAT
- RED is leading by 2 VP and has the longest road bonus

## Board Analysis
- I have 4 settlements but no cities yet
- I need ore to build cities or buy development cards
- RED has the longest road with 6 segments (I have 5 currently)
- The robber is on a brick hex (0,-1,1)

## Resource Analysis
With my current hand (1 WOOD, 2 SHEEP, 2 WHEAT), I cannot:
- Build a settlement (need WOOD, BRICK, SHEEP, WHEAT)
- Build a city (need 3 ORE, 2 WHEAT)
- Buy a development card (need 1 ORE, 1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT)
- Build a road (need 1 WOOD, 1 BRICK)

## Available Actions
The only options are:
- [0] End turn (no actions possible)
- [1-4] Trade using ports (but I don't have enough resources)

Looking at the port options:
- Options 1-4 all require giving 2 resources of the same type
- I only have 2 SHEEP and 2 WHEAT, but these options require "Give 2 None"
- This seems to be an error in the action description - I likely need to give 2 SHEEP for another resource or 2 WHEAT for another resource

Even if the port trading was possible, I need both WOOD and BRICK to build a road, or ORE for development cards/cities.

## Strategic Evaluation
Since I can't perform any meaningful action with my current resources, the best move is to end my turn and collect more resources on the next round, hoping for better options.

<plan>
1. End turn and collect resources
2. Focus on getting ORE and BRICK in upcoming turns
3. Build roads to challenge RED for longest road
4. Either build settlements at locations with ORE or upgrade to cities when possible
5. Consider buying development cards if I get ORE to potentially get Knights or Victory Points
</plan>

Given the available options and my current resources, I must:

# Game Analysis: Turn 90 as Blue Player

Let me analyze the current game situation and available options:

## Current Board Position

- **Blue (me)**: 4 VP (all from settlements)
  - Resources: 1 Wood, 2 Sheep, 3 Wheat, 1 Ore
  - 7 roads built (longest: 5)
  
- **Red (opponent)**: 7 VP (3 VP from settlements, 2 VP from city, 2 VP from longest road)
  - 7 hidden resource cards
  - Longest road (6 segments)
  - Strong position at 7/10 VP

## Victory Point Gap Analysis
I'm at 4 VP, while Red is at 7 VP, putting me 3 VP behind. Red is dangerously close to winning.

## Available Actions
0. End turn
1. Buy development card (costs 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore)
2-5. Maritime trades (2:1 using my sheep port)

## Action Analysis

**Option 1: Buy Development Card**
- Costs: 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore
- Potential gains:
  - Knight (helps toward Largest Army)
  - Victory Point card (hidden VP)
  - Road Building, Year of Plenty, or Monopoly

Given my limited resources and Red being at 7 VP, a development card could be crucial:
- If I get a VP card, that's +1 VP without Red knowing
- If I get a Knight, it's progress toward Largest Army (2 VP)
- Utility cards could help my position next turn

**Option 0: End Turn**
Not using my resources now means missing an opportunity to potentially close the VP gap.

**Options 2-5: Maritime Trades**
None of these trades help me take an immediate action that would improve my position.

## Strategic Analysis
Red is at 7 VP and likely planning to reach 10 VP soon. I need to take actions that both improve my position and potentially disrupt Red's path to victory.

A development card represents my best chance to:
1. Potentially get a hidden VP
2. Work toward Largest Army (2 VP)
3. Gain a utility card that could change game dynamics next turn

<plan>
1. Buy a development card now to potentially gain VP or Knights
2. Focus on challenging Red for longest road in coming turns
3. Look for settlement opportunities to increase VP and resource generation
4. Prepare to block Red's expansion if they try to build new settlements
5. Consider city upgrades when I collect more ore
</plan>

Given that Red is so close to winning at 7 VP, I need to take the most strategic action available, which is buying a development card that might give me an immediate VP or tools to strengthen my position.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 92 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

  1. Buy a development card now to potentially gain VP or Knights
2. Focus on challenging Red for longest road in coming turns
3. Look for settlement opportunities to increase VP and resource generation
4. Prepare to block Red's expansion if they try to build new settlements
5. Consider city upgrades when I collect more ore
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

❓ Select action by number (0-1):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I need to analyze the current game state and determine whether to play my Knight card now or roll the dice.

# Game State Analysis
- I (BLUE) have 4 VP (4 settlements × 1 VP each)
- RED has 7 VP (3 settlements × 1 VP each + 1 city × 2 VP + Longest Road 2 VP)
- RED is 3 points ahead and only needs 3 more points to win
- I have 1 Knight card I could play
- I have limited resources: 1 wood, 1 sheep, 1 wheat

# Strategic Considerations

## Option 0: Playing Knight Card
- Advantages:
  - Can move the robber to block RED's key production
  - Can steal a resource from RED (they have 8 cards)
  - Could protect my key production areas from the robber
  - Gets me closer to Largest Army (I'd have 2 knights, need 3 total)
- Disadvantages:
  - Knight is a valuable card to save for later when strategically more necessary
  - I don't have immediate building plans that require additional resources
  - RED doesn't currently have the robber on one of my hexes

## Option 1: Rolling Dice
- Advantages:
  - Could get more resources to build with
  - Saves Knight card for when I truly need it
  - Normal progression of play
- Disadvantages:
  - If I roll a 7, I'd need to move the robber anyway without the benefit of the Knight card
  - RED could potentially build on their next turn and get closer to winning

# Decision Making
RED is at 7 VP and clearly ahead. The robber is currently on hex (0,0,0) which is a wood hex with number 6 - this is my most productive hex (I have a settlement at node 2 that produces from this hex).

By playing my Knight card, I can move the robber off my best production hex AND potentially steal a valuable resource from RED who has 8 cards. This is a double benefit. Additionally, playing the Knight advances me toward the Largest Army bonus, which could be my path to victory since RED already has Longest Road.

Looking at my current plan, the first step was to "Buy a development card now to potentially gain VP or Knights" - however, I already have a Knight. Using it effectively is better than saving it at this point, especially since the robber is on my best resource.

<plan>
1. Play Knight card to move robber off my wood 6 and onto RED's best hex
2. Build roads to establish longest road (challenge RED for this 2 VP bonus)
3. Look for settlement opportunities at strategic locations
4. Save resources to upgrade one settlement to a city
5. Consider buying development cards if I have extra ore/wheat
</plan>

Given the current situation where the robber is on my best production hex, playing the Knight card now provides immediate value and is the optimal play.

# Robber Placement Analysis

Let me think step by step about the optimal robber placement to maximize my chances of winning.

## Current Game Status
- RED has 7VP (3 settlements, 1 city, longest road bonus)
- BLUE (me) has 4VP (4 settlements)
- RED is 3VP ahead - they are much closer to winning
- Robber is currently on (0,0,0) which is a Wood 6 hex (high probability)

## Strategic Goal Assessment
I need to:
1. Slow RED down as they're close to winning
2. Protect my high-value resources
3. Potentially steal a valuable resource from RED
4. Disrupt RED's resource production

## Hex Analysis
Let me identify RED's most productive hexes:
- Node 6: RED's city produces from ⛏️5, 🐑8, and 🌲9
- Node 20: RED settlement produces from 🐑6, 🐑8, and 🌾3
- Node 21: RED settlement produces from 🐑6, ⛏️4, and 🌲12

The highest value targets appear to be:
- (1,0,-1): 🐑8 - affects both RED's city at node 6 and settlement at node 20
- (0,1,-1): 🐑6 - affects both RED settlements at node 20 and node 21

## Optimal Robber Placement
Option [5] Move robber to (1,0,-1) and steal from RED seems optimal because:
- It blocks a high-probability sheep hex (8)
- It impacts two of RED's buildings simultaneously (one being a city)
- It allows me to steal from RED
- Sheep is likely abundant for RED as they have multiple sheep-producing hexes

Option [4] Move robber to (0,1,-1) and steal from RED is also strong as it blocks another sheep hex affecting two RED buildings.

<plan>
1. Move robber to RED's sheep 8 (1,0,-1) hex to disrupt their production from multiple buildings
2. Continue building roads to challenge longest road bonus
3. Look for settlement opportunities at strategic locations
4. Save resources to upgrade one settlement to a city
5. Consider buying development cards for hidden VPs or knights
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I choose option [5] to move the robber to (1,0,-1) and steal from RED.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 96 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Move robber to RED's sheep 8 (1,0,-1) hex to disrupt their production from multiple buildings
2. Continue building roads to challenge longest road bonus
3. Look for settlement opportunities at strategic locations
4. Save resources to upgrade one settlement to a city
5. Consider buying development cards for hidden VPs or knights

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and make the best decision for this turn.

## Current Situation:
- I (BLUE) have 4 VP (4 settlements) vs RED with 7 VP (3 settlements, 1 city, longest road bonus)
- My resources: 4 🌲WOOD, 1 🐑SHEEP, 2 🌾WHEAT
- RED is ahead by 3 points and has the longest road bonus
- The robber is currently on RED's sheep hex (1,0,-1), which is already disrupting their production

## Strategic Considerations:

1. **Victory Path**: RED is at 7 VP, so they're close to winning. I need to accelerate my point acquisition.
2. **Resource Analysis**: I have wood (4), wheat (2), and sheep (1), but no ore or brick.
3. **Potential Builds**: I can't build any settlements, cities, or roads with my current resources.
4. **Trading Options**: I could trade 4 wood for 1 brick, which would allow me to build a road, but this is inefficient.

## Analysis of Available Actions:

**[0] End Turn**
This seems the only reasonable option. None of the trades are efficient enough to be worth making this turn. I should save my resources for more valuable builds next turn.

**[1-4] Maritime Trade Options**
Trading 4 wood for 1 of any resource is a very poor rate. Even for brick, I would still need one more brick to build a road. This would deplete my wood reserves for minimal gain.

I note that I have access to the 2:1 sheep port (at nodes 32,33), but I don't have enough sheep to utilize it efficiently.

## Strategic Plan Update:
<plan>
1. Save resources this turn by ending turn
2. Next turn, aim to build roads to challenge longest road bonus
3. Look for settlement opportunities at strategic locations
4. Prioritize getting access to ore for city upgrades
5. Consider buying development cards if I get ore and wheat
</plan>

For this turn, the optimal move is to end my turn and conserve resources for better building opportunities in future turns.

5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 98 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Save resources this turn by ending turn
2. Next turn, aim to build roads to challenge longest road bonus
3. Look for settlement opportunities at strategic locations
4. Prioritize getting access to ore for city upgrades
5. Consider buying development cards if I get ore and wheat

# Game Analysis for Turn 98

Let me analyze the current game state and make the optimal decision:

## Current Status Summary
- I'm BLUE with 4 victory points (4 settlements)
- RED has 7 victory points (3 settlements, 1 city, longest road bonus)
- My resources: 5 Wood, 1 Sheep, 2 Wheat
- No ore or brick currently available to me
- RED is 3 points ahead and close to winning

## Resource Analysis
I have:
- Good wood production (dice 6)
- Limited sheep, wheat production
- No current ore or brick production

## Available Actions
- End turn [0]
- Maritime trades to convert wood to other resources [1-4]

## Strategic Options Analysis

1. **End Turn Option:**
   - Preserves my 5 wood, 1 sheep, 2 wheat
   - No immediate progress toward victory points
   - Risk of losing resources if 7 is rolled

2. **Maritime Trade Options:**
   - I could trade 4 wood for 1 brick and have 1 wood left - but can't build anything useful with just that
   - I could trade 4 wood for 1 ore, but still can't build anything meaningful
   - None of the trades would enable me to make a significant move this turn

## Path to Victory Assessment
I need to gain 6 more victory points to win. Options:
- Cities (need ore and wheat)
- More settlements (need wood, brick, wheat, sheep)
- Development cards (need ore, wheat, sheep)
- Challenge longest road (need wood and brick for more roads)

With my current resources and position, I cannot make meaningful progress this turn through any of the trades.

<plan>
1. End turn to preserve resources
2. Focus on gaining brick in next turns to build roads (5 wood will be valuable)
3. Challenge RED for longest road (+2 VP) since I already have 7 roads built
4. Look for settlement opportunities at strategic locations
5. If I get ore, prioritize development cards for potential knights and victory points
</plan>

Given the game state, the most strategic choice is to end my turn and preserve my resources for more impactful moves next turn.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 100 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and available actions:

## Current Position
- I (BLUE) have 4 VP (4 settlements)
- RED has 7 VP (3 settlements + 1 city + longest road bonus)
- RED is 3 points ahead and close to winning (needs 3 more VP)
- I have 5 🌲WOOD, 1 🐑SHEEP, 2 🌾WHEAT resources
- My current plan aims to challenge RED for longest road

## Options Analysis

**[0] End Turn**
- Preserves my current resources
- Does nothing to advance my position
- RED will get another turn, bringing them closer to victory

**Maritime Trade Options [1-4]**
- All require 4 WOOD (standard 4:1 trading, no port advantage)
- Trading 4 WOOD would leave me with 1 WOOD + whatever I receive
- None of these trades enable immediate building actions

## Strategic Considerations

1. **Resource Efficiency**: 4:1 trades are inefficient
2. **Board Position**: I have 7 roads vs RED's 10 roads (longest: RED has 8, I have 5)
3. **Victory Path**: To challenge for longest road, I need BRICK, but trading 4 WOOD for 1 BRICK is inefficient
4. **Timing**: I can preserve resources for next turn when I might roll more favorable resources

## Decision Logic

I can't take any productive building actions this turn. The 4:1 maritime trades are highly inefficient, especially since I would use most of my wood for a single resource that still doesn't enable any immediate builds.

My current plan of challenging RED for longest road is still valid, but trading 4:1 for a single BRICK doesn't advance this efficiently. It's better to wait, keep my resources, and hope for better rolls or trading opportunities next turn.

<plan>
1. End turn to preserve resources
2. Focus on gaining brick in future rolls
3. Challenge RED for longest road (+2 VP) by extending my 5-segment road to 9+ segments
4. Look for settlement opportunities at strategic locations
5. If I get ore, prioritize development cards for potential knights and victory points
</plan>

The optimal action is to end my turn.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current situation:

## Victory Points
- Me (BLUE): 4 VP (4 settlements)
- RED: 7 VP (3 settlements, 1 city, longest road bonus)

RED is ahead by 3 VP and only needs 3 more to win.

## Resources
I have 4 🌲WOOD and no other resources. This limits my immediate build options significantly.

## Roads & Expansion
- I have a 5-segment longest road, while RED has an 8-segment longest road.
- Taking longest road would give me +2 VP, but would require extending from 5 to at least 9 segments.
- This would require at least 4 more roads = 4 wood + 4 brick.

## Available Actions
My options are limited to:
1. End turn
2-5. Maritime trades to convert my 4 wood into another resource

## Strategic Assessment

I need to consider what's most valuable right now:
- I need brick for road building
- I need ore/wheat for development cards (potential VPs or knights)
- I need sheep for development cards

The current plan has me challenging RED for longest road, but:
- I need brick to build roads
- I currently have 4 wood, which is enough for a 4:1 maritime trade for 1 brick
- With 1 brick + remaining wood from future rolls, I could start building roads

Looking at my production:
- I have good wood production (6, high probability)
- I have less brick production (just one 11 hex, which is lower probability)
- I need brick more than other resources for my road strategy

<plan>
1. Convert wood to brick via maritime trade
2. Continue to collect resources for road building
3. Extend roads strategically to reach 9+ segments and take longest road (+2 VP)
4. Look for settlement opportunities along new road paths
5. If excess resources, consider development cards for knights/VPs
</plan>

Given my need for brick to execute my road-building strategy and limited brick production, trading my 4 wood for 1 brick is the most strategic move now.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:

- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section

# Game Analysis for Turn 118

## Current Situation Assessment
- I have 4 VP (4 settlements)
- Red has 9 VP (5 settlements + 1 city + longest road bonus)
- Red is only 1 VP away from victory
- I have limited resources: 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 sheep
- The robber is on a brick hex (0,-1,1)

## Strategic Analysis
Red is about to win with 9 VP. My current plan focused on building toward longest road, but I need to reassess if this is viable given my current position.

### Options Assessment:
1. Build a road with my wood and brick
2. End turn and collect more resources

Building a road would use all my wood and brick resources, leaving me with just 1 sheep. While this contributes toward my longest road goal, I'm far behind with only 5 connected segments versus Red's 8. Additionally, I don't have enough resources to make meaningful progress toward taking longest road this turn.

Red has 7 hidden resources, which means they may be able to build their final victory point (settlement, city upgrade, or development card) on their next turn.

<plan>
1. Conserve resources and end turn
2. On future turns, focus on development cards for potential knights/victory points rather than longest road
3. Try to block Red's expansion with strategic road placement when resources allow
4. Target ore and wheat production to enable city upgrades and development cards
</plan>

Since I cannot make significant progress toward victory this turn, and building a single road would deplete my resources without changing the game state meaningfully, the optimal move is to end my turn.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state carefully:

## Victory Points
- BLUE (me): 4 VPs (4 settlements)
- RED: 9 VPs (5 settlements + 1 city + Longest Road bonus)
- RED is just 1 VP away from winning!

## Resources Available to Me
- 2 Wood
- 1 Brick
- 1 Sheep
- Total: 4 cards

## Potential Actions
- I can build a road (costs 1 Wood + 1 Brick)
- I don't have enough resources for other builds (settlements, cities, dev cards)

## Strategic Assessment

This is a critical situation. RED has 9 VPs and is likely to win on their next turn. My chances of winning are very slim, but I should take actions that:
1. Potentially block RED from getting their final VP
2. Set myself up for future resource acquisition

Looking at the road options:
- None of my potential roads allow me to immediately build a settlement (I don't have enough resources anyway)
- I should consider roads that might block RED or position me better for future turns

## Detailed Road Option Analysis

Since RED has 9 points already (1 away from winning) and I'm far behind at 4 points, my best move is defensive.

Road placement options:
1. Edge (0, 1) - Connects toward center of board
2. Edge (9, 10) - Connects toward a brick port
3. Edge (35, 36) - Connects to a 2:1 wood port
4. Edge (31, 32) - Connects nodes near my settlement
5. Edge (2, 3) - Extends from my productive settlement
6. Edge (11, 12) - Connects toward brick/wheat areas
7. Edge (8, 9) - Connects toward 5-wheat area
8. Edge (10, 29) - Connects toward brick port
9. Edge (1, 6) - May block RED's expansion
10. Edge (13, 34) - Connects my settlements

Given RED's dominance and proximity to victory, I should prioritize either:
1) Building a road that might block RED from a critical expansion point
2) Building a road that improves my position for resource generation

Road option 9 (Edge 1, 6) seems to be the most potentially disruptive to RED as it could block their expansion. It's also heading toward RED's strong resource-producing areas.

<plan>
1. Build road at edge (1, 6) to potentially block RED's expansion
2. Focus on development cards on future turns for potential knights/victory points
3. Try to interfere with RED's final VP attempt
4. Target ore and wheat production for city upgrades when possible
</plan>

Given the critical game state and my limited options, I choose to:

\boxed{9}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

RESPONSE:
I need to analyze the optimal location for my first initial settlement. Since this is the initial placement phase, I'll focus on securing high-probability numbers and diverse resources following the initial placement strategy.

Let me analyze the best settlement locations based on:
1. High probability numbers (6,8)
2. Resource diversity
3. Future expansion potential
4. Position relative to RED player
5. Access to ports

Looking at the high-value hexes:
- 🌲8 at (-2, 0, 2) and (2, 0, -2)
- 🐑6 at (1, -1, 0) 
- 🌾6 at (1, 1, -2)

I see that RED has already secured node 22 which gives them access to 🌾6, 🌲8, and ⛏️5 - a strong position with high-probability numbers.

Let me check the most promising nodes:

**Node 8**: Connects to 🌾3, 🧱10, and 🐑6 - includes one 6 (high probability)
**Node 13**: Connects to 🌲8, ⛏️3, and 🐑9 - includes one 8 (high probability)
**Node 19**: Connects to 🌲10, 🌾6, and 🐑5 - includes one 6 (high probability)
**Node 36**: Connects to 🌲8, 🐑9, and near a 3:1 port - includes one 8 (high probability)
**Node 49**: Connects to 🌲8, 🌾6, and near 3:1 port - includes two high probability numbers (6,8)

Node 49 stands out as particularly strong with two high-probability numbers (6 and 8) and access to both wheat and wood. It's also on the opposite side of the board from RED, which follows our strategy of spreading out.

For initial placement, I should place my settlement far from RED to maximize my expansion options. Node 49 is an excellent choice because:
1. It gives me access to two high-probability resources (🌲8 and 🌾6)
2. It's on the opposite side of the board from RED
3. It's near a 3:1 port
4. It gives me good expansion opportunities

After placing here, I'll be able to secure wheat and wood production, which I can later complement with other resources through my second settlement.

<plan>
1. Place first settlement at node 49 to secure high-probability wood and wheat (8,6)
2. For second settlement, look to secure ore, brick, and sheep resources
3. Initial road should point toward promising expansion spots or valuable ports
4. Focus on early expansion to diverse resources before upgrading to cities
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Analyzing Settlers of Catan Initial Road Placement

I need to choose the optimal initial road placement for my first settlement at node 50.

## Current Game State
- I've placed my first settlement at node 50, which is on a wood hex with a probability 8 (excellent)
- This is my free initial road placement (no resource cost)
- I have two options: road (50, 51) or road (49, 50)

## Option Analysis

### Option 0: Build road at edge (50, 51)
- Direction: This leads toward nodes 51 and 52
- Node 51 connects to wood (8)
- Node 52 connects to wood (8) and desert (robber) 
- There's a 3:1 general port at nodes 52-53
- Expansion potential: Limited diversity, only leads to more wood and a 3:1 port

### Option 1: Build road at edge (49, 50)
- Direction: This leads toward nodes 49 and 46
- Node 49 connects to wood (8) and wheat (6) - both excellent probabilities
- There's a 3:1 general port at nodes 48-49
- Further expansion could lead to sheep (5) via node 46
- Expansion potential: Provides access to wheat (6) and potential future access to sheep

## Strategic Considerations
1. For my second settlement, I need to secure diverse resources (especially ore, brick, and sheep)
2. My initial road should point toward promising expansion opportunities
3. The road should facilitate future settlements with diverse resource access

<plan>
1. Place first road at edge (49, 50) to access wheat (6) resource via node 49
2. For second settlement, look for a location with ore and brick access
3. After initial placements, expand toward sheep resources to complete resource diversity
4. Focus on early expansion to secure all resource types before prioritizing city upgrades
</plan>

Road option 1 clearly provides better expansion potential toward wheat (6) which is a high-probability hex and creates a path toward additional resource diversity. This aligns with the initial placement strategy of securing diverse resources.

# Analyzing Initial Settlement Placement

I need to analyze the board to find the optimal location for my second initial settlement. This is a critical decision as it will shape my resource production for the entire game.

Key considerations:
1. Access to high-probability numbers (6, 8)
2. Resource diversity (getting access to resources I don't have)
3. Access to ports that complement my strategy
4. Position on opposite side from my first settlement
5. Future expansion potential

## Current Status
- My first settlement is at node 50, producing wood (8)
- RED player has a settlement at node 22, which produces ore (5), wheat (6), and wood (8)

## Resource Analysis
I already have strong wood production (8). I should prioritize:
- Ore and wheat (for city upgrades)
- Brick (for expansion)
- Sheep (for complete resource diversity)

## Evaluating Top Options

Looking at nodes with high-value number combinations, strong resource diversity, and good expansion potential:

### Node 13
- Resources: Ore (3), Sheep (9), Wood (8)
- Numbers: 3⭐, 9⭐⭐, 8⭐⭐⭐
- Pros: Wood (8), close to wheat port, opposite side from my first settlement
- Cons: Ore only has 3 (low probability), not a great number mix

### Node 10
- Resources: Wood (12), Brick (10), Wheat (11)
- Numbers: 12⭐, 10⭐⭐, 11⭐⭐
- Pros: Good resource diversity, decent numbers
- Cons: No high-probability numbers

### Node 29
- Resources: Wood (12), Brick (10), Wheat (3)
- Numbers: 12⭐, 10⭐⭐, 3⭐
- Pros: Access to ore port, access to brick
- Cons: Low probability numbers

### Node 32
- Resources: Wood (12), Ore (3), Wheat (11)
- Numbers: 12⭐, 3⭐, 11⭐⭐
- Pros: Access to wheat port, good resource diversity
- Cons: Low probability on ore

### Node 37
- Resources: Wood (8), Brick (9), Ore (3)
- Numbers: 8⭐⭐⭐, 9⭐⭐, 3⭐
- Pros: High-probability wood, access to brick
- Cons: Low probability on ore

### Node 12
- Resources: Ore (3), Wheat (11), Sheep (9)
- Numbers: 3⭐, 11⭐⭐, 9⭐⭐
- Pros: Great resource diversity, decent numbers
- Cons: No high-probability numbers

## Best Option Analysis

I need ore and wheat for city upgrades, and I already have good wood production. Looking at the best combination of resources, probability, and position, node 12 stands out:

Node 12:
- Gives me ore (3), wheat (11), and sheep (9)
- Combined with my first settlement (wood 8), I have 4 out of 5 resources
- Located opposite to my first settlement
- Has decent number probability (3⭐, 11⭐⭐, 9⭐⭐)
- Good expansion potential toward brick resources
- Close to useful ports

<plan>
1. Place second settlement at node 12 to secure ore, wheat, and sheep
2. After initial placements, focus on expanding toward brick resources
3. Use my wood production to trade for brick when needed
4. Prioritize early city upgrades once I have ore access
5. Consider development cards to supplement my strategy if ore/wheat production is strong
</plan>

Based on my analysis, I choose node 12 for my second settlement placement.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 1 | Player: BLUE | Action: BUILD_INITIAL_ROAD

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Place second settlement at node 12 to secure ore, wheat, and sheep
2. After initial placements, focus on expanding toward brick resources
3. Use my wood production to trade for brick when needed
4. Prioritize early city upgrades once I have ore access
5. Consider development cards to supplement my strategy if ore/wheat production is strong

# Game Analysis for Initial Road Placement

I need to decide where to place my second initial road from my second settlement at node 12. Since this is still the initial placement phase, I don't need to spend resources for this road. This is a critical decision as it will determine my early expansion path.

## Evaluating My Current Position:

- I have settlements at nodes 12 and 50
- Node 12 gives me access to wheat (11), sheep (9), and ore (3)
- Node 50 gives me access to wood (8)
- I'm currently missing brick production
- My settlements are on opposite sides of the board, giving me expansion flexibility

## Analyzing Road Options:

**Option 0: Build road at edge (12, 13)**
- Direction: Connects toward ore (3) hex and wood (8) hex
- Future potential: Can connect to wheat port at nodes 32-33
- Resource diversity: Strengthens access to resources I already have

**Option 1: Build road at edge (11, 12)**
- Direction: Connects toward wheat (11) and wood (12) hexes
- Future potential: No immediate valuable building spots
- Resource diversity: Doesn't open new resource access

**Option 2: Build road at edge (3, 12)**
- Direction: Heads toward wheat (11), sheep (2), and sheep (6) hexes
- Future potential: Could reach brick (10) hex in the future
- Resource diversity: Provides path to access brick, which I currently lack

## Strategic Considerations:

My main weakness is lack of brick production. Looking at the board, there are brick hexes at (1, -2, 1) with a 10 roll and (-2, 1, 1) with a 9 roll. For efficient expansion, I need to secure brick access.

Option 2 (edge 3, 12) offers the best path toward accessing brick resources which I currently lack. It also positions me to potentially build toward the 2:1 ore port, which would be valuable since I have some ore production already.

<plan>
1. Place initial road at edge (3, 12) to begin expansion toward brick resources
2. Focus early game on building toward node 9 to access brick (10)
3. Use my wood (8) production as trade leverage to acquire brick when needed
4. Once I secure brick access, prioritize building 1-2 more settlements
5. Then transition to upgrading settlements to cities using ore/wheat
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I'll choose option 2 to build my initial road at edge (3, 12), which gives me the best path toward accessing brick resources that I currently lack.

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 3 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Place initial road at edge (3, 12) to begin expansion toward brick resources
2. Focus early game on building toward node 9 to access brick (10)
3. Use my wood (8) production as trade leverage to acquire brick when needed
4. Once I secure brick access, prioritize building 1-2 more settlements
5. Then transition to upgrading settlements to cities using ore/wheat

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze my current game state and options:

## Current Resources:
- 1 🐑 SHEEP
- 1 🌾 WHEAT
- 1 ⛏️ ORE

## Available Actions:
- [0] End turn
- [1] Buy a development card (costs exactly what I have: 1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE)

## Board Position Analysis:
- I have settlements at nodes 50 (produces wood on 8) and 12 (produces wheat on 11, sheep on 9, ore on 3)
- My initial road placement is at edges (49, 50) and (3, 12)
- The robber is on the desert hex, not blocking any production
- RED player has settlements at nodes 22 and 14, with good production from 5, 6, 8, 9

## Strategic Considerations:

1. **Development Card Option**:
   - Could potentially get a Victory Point card (hidden until win)
   - Could get a Knight to start building toward Largest Army
   - Could get Year of Plenty or Monopoly which could help with future resource shortages
   - Development cards provide flexibility and surprise elements

2. **Saving Resources**:
   - Ending turn means saving my current resources
   - However, I don't have enough resources to build anything useful next turn without good rolls
   - Risk of holding cards if the number 7 is rolled (robber)
   - Not making progress this turn
   
3. **My Current Plan**:
   - My plan mentions expanding toward brick resources
   - However, I don't have enough resources for road building this turn
   - Development card purchase doesn't directly align with my road expansion plan
   - But development cards are good for long-term strategy

<plan>
1. Buy a development card this turn to make progress with my limited resources
2. Continue focusing on expanding toward node 9 to access brick (10) in future turns
3. Continue using my wood (8) production as trade leverage
4. Once I secure brick access, build 1-2 more settlements
5. Then transition to city upgrades using ore/wheat
</plan>

Since I have exactly the resources needed for a development card and cannot progress with roads or settlements this turn, buying a development card is the optimal move. This aligns with the balanced growth strategy of "always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card."

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

# Game Analysis: Blue's Turn 5

Let me analyze my current situation as the Blue player:

## Current Position
- I have 2 victory points from my 2 settlements
- I have only 1 wood resource card
- I have 1 knight development card
- My settlements are at node 50 (produces wood on 8) and node 12 (produces wheat on 11, sheep on 9, and ore on 3)
- The robber is currently on the desert hex (2,-1,-1), not blocking any production

## Available Actions
- [0] Play Knight card - Move the robber and steal a resource
- [1] Roll the dice

## Strategic Analysis

First, let me consider playing the knight card:
- Advantages: I could move the robber to block Red's strong resource production (possibly the 8 wood or 6 wheat tile)
- I could potentially steal a useful resource from Red
- This would give me progress toward Largest Army (currently at 0 knights)
- However, I'd still need to roll afterward to try to get resources

For rolling the dice:
- This is the normal turn progression
- Based on my settlements, I could potentially get wood (8), wheat (11), sheep (9), or ore (3)
- Wood (8) has the highest probability (rolled 5/36 times)
- I'd then have the option to trade or build depending on my roll outcome

<plan>
1. Roll the dice to collect resources - hopefully wood (8)
2. If I get enough resources, build a road toward node 9 to access brick (10) in future turns
3. If resources are insufficient for immediate building, consider trading or saving
4. Keep the knight card for strategic use later, when I really need to block an opponent or steal a specific resource
5. Long-term: Continue toward node 9, secure brick access, then build more settlements before upgrading to cities
</plan>

Given that it's early in the game (Turn 5) and the robber isn't currently blocking any of my production, playing the knight now would be premature. It's a valuable card that should be saved for a more strategic moment - either to protect my resources from a robber, to block a critical opponent's resource, or to secure Largest Army when I have more knight cards.

The most sensible action is to roll the dice and see what resources I collect.

3. If resources are insufficient for immediate building, consider trading or saving
4. Keep the knight card for strategic use later, when I really need to block an opponent or steal a specific resource
5. Long-term: Continue toward node 9, secure brick access, then build more settlements before upgrading to cities

# Game Analysis for Turn 5

Let me analyze my current situation and the available actions:

## Current Resources & Cards
- I have only 1 wood resource
- I have 1 knight development card
- I have 2 victory points from my 2 settlements

## Board Position Analysis
- My settlements are at node 50 (producing wood on 8) and node 12 (producing wheat on 11, sheep on 9, and ore on 3)
- I have roads at (49, 50) and (3, 12)
- The robber is currently on the desert hex (2, -1, -1), so it's not blocking any production
- Red has settlements on high-value spots producing wood(8), wheat(6), ore(5), sheep(9), and brick(9)

## Available Actions
0. Play Knight card - Move the robber and steal a resource
1. End my turn

## Decision Analysis

With just 1 wood resource, I can't build anything this turn (roads require wood + brick, settlements require wood + brick + wheat + sheep). 

**Option 0: Play Knight Card**
- Pros: Could steal a useful resource from Red, who has 5 cards
- Pros: Could block one of Red's productive hexes (like the 8-wood or 6-wheat)
- Pros: Progress toward Largest Army (2VP)
- Cons: Knight cards are most valuable when I'm threatened by the robber or need a specific resource
- Cons: I'm not in immediate danger from the robber since it's on the desert
- Cons: Saving the knight for a more strategic moment might be better

**Option 1: End Turn**
- Pros: Save the knight card for when it's more valuable
- Pros: No resources would be wasted
- Cons: This turn becomes essentially a "pass"

<plan>
1. Roll dice to collect resources next turn
2. Save my knight card for a more strategic time (when robber threatens my production or I need a specific resource)
3. Next turn, if I get brick, build a road toward node 9 to access additional brick (10)
4. Continue expansion toward areas with resources I lack (especially brick)
5. Long-term: build 1-2 more settlements before upgrading to cities
</plan>

I don't have enough resources to build anything this turn. Playing the knight now would be premature - knight cards are more valuable when:
1. I need to protect my high-value hexes from the robber
2. I need to steal a specific resource for an immediate build
3. I'm actively competing for largest army

Since none of these conditions apply right now, I'll end my turn and save the knight for a more strategic moment.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis - Settlers of Catan Turn 7

I need to decide between playing my Knight card (option 0) or rolling the dice (option 1).

## Current Game Evaluation
- I have 2 VP from my 2 settlements
- Resources: 1 wood, 1 sheep (limited)
- Development cards: 1 Knight card
- My settlements produce wood (8), wheat (11), sheep (9), and ore (3)
- The robber is on (2,-1,-1) - this is not affecting my production
- Red has 3 VP from 3 settlements and more resources than me (3 cards)

## Knight Card Analysis
Knight cards provide these benefits:
1. Move the robber to block an opponent's resource production
2. Steal a resource from an opponent
3. Contribute toward Largest Army (2 VP for 3+ knights)

Currently, the robber is not on any of my hexes, so I'm not under pressure to move it. Red has 3 settlements producing well (including two 6s, an 8, and a 10), so placing the robber could slow them down.

## Roll Benefits
If I roll the dice:
- I have settlements on numbers 3, 8, 9, and 11
- Potential to gain more resources immediately
- Can save the Knight for a more strategic moment

## Strategic Considerations
1. I'm resource-poor with only 2 cards, so gaining resources this turn is critical
2. I'm early in my development path and need resources to build more roads and settlements
3. The Knight could be saved for when:
   - The robber is placed on one of my key hexes
   - I'm closer to getting Largest Army
   - I need a specific resource from an opponent

<plan>
1. Roll dice to collect resources and build my economy
2. Save Knight card for when the robber threatens my production or when I need a specific resource
3. Next turn, aim to build roads toward node 9 to access the brick (10) production
4. Continue expansion toward areas with resources I lack (especially brick)
5. Long-term: build 1-2 more settlements before upgrading to cities
</plan>

Since I'm early in the game with few resources, and the robber isn't currently affecting me, rolling the dice to collect more resources is the optimal move. The Knight card will be more valuable later when I have a clearer path to Largest Army or need targeted protection.

# Game Analysis for Turn 7 as Blue Player

Let me carefully analyze my options for this turn.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I (BLUE) have 2 VP from my 2 settlements
- I have limited resources: 1 wood, 1 sheep
- I have 1 Knight development card
- RED has 3 settlements (3 VP) and is ahead of me
- The robber is currently on the desert hex (2,-1,-1), not affecting any resource production

## Resource Analysis
My current holdings (1 wood, 1 sheep) are insufficient to build anything:
- Settlement costs: 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 sheep, 1 wheat
- Road costs: 1 wood, 1 brick
- Development card costs: 1 ore, 1 sheep, 1 wheat

## Action Option Analysis

### Option 0: Play Knight Card
Benefits:
- Could move the robber to a valuable hex for RED (perhaps the 8 wood or 6 wheat hex)
- Could steal a resource from RED (they have 3 cards)
- Would start building toward "Largest Army" (need 3 knights total)

Drawbacks:
- Knight cards are more valuable in certain situations (when robber is on my hex, when I need specific resources)
- Using it now means I won't have it for protection later

### Option 1: End Turn
Benefits:
- Conserve the Knight card for a more strategic moment
- My settlements will produce resources on my next roll, potentially allowing me to build

Drawbacks:
- "Wasting" a turn without making progress
- RED will get to roll and likely strengthen their position

## Strategic Considerations
1. The Knight card is currently my only potential play
2. Playing the Knight would disrupt RED's production and potentially gain me a resource
3. However, RED has 3 settlements in strong positions, and I may need the Knight later for defense
4. My next priority should be building more settlements, which requires resources I don't currently have
5. Ending my turn allows me to roll on my next turn and potentially collect enough resources to build

<plan>
1. Conserve Knight card for defensive use or when I need specific resources
2. On next turn, focus on collecting resources to build roads toward promising settlement locations
3. Target building settlements near resources I'm lacking (especially brick and wheat)
4. Only use the Knight card when it provides significant strategic advantage
5. Long-term: build 1-2 more settlements before upgrading to cities
</plan>

Given that I have insufficient resources to build anything significant, and the robber isn't currently affecting my production, I'll conserve my Knight card for a more critical moment. The optimal move is to end my turn and wait for my next resource production.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

RESPONSE:
# Game Analysis for Turn 9

I need to decide between playing my Knight card now or rolling the dice. Let me analyze the current game state to make the optimal choice.

## Current Game State
- I have 2 VP (2 settlements) vs Red's 3 VP (3 settlements)
- Resources: 2 Wood, 1 Sheep
- I have 1 Knight card available
- The robber is currently on the desert tile (2, -1, -1), which is not affecting anyone's production

## Option 0: Play Knight Card
If I play the Knight card now:
- Benefits:
  - Could steal a resource from Red (they have 5 cards)
  - Could place robber on a productive hex for Red (like 6 wheat or 8 wood)
  - Would be my first step toward Largest Army (need 3 total)
- Downsides:
  - I'm not in immediate danger from the robber (it's on desert)
  - I have no immediate build opportunities to capitalize on the stolen resource
  - Using the Knight now means I won't have it for defense if needed later

## Option 1: Roll the Dice
If I roll the dice:
- I could gain more resources based on my settlements (8 wood, 11 wheat, 9 sheep, 3 ore)
- With more resources, I might be able to build something immediately
- Keeps my Knight card for when I truly need it (defense or later strategic timing)

## Strategic Considerations
- I'm currently lacking brick completely in my resource production
- I should be looking to expand toward brick and better wheat production
- The Knight is most valuable when:
  1. Protecting against a 7 roll when over 7 cards
  2. Removing a robber blocking my key production
  3. Blocking an opponent's critical production
  4. As part of a path to largest army

Currently, none of these conditions apply. I'm not over 7 cards, the robber isn't blocking me, and I don't have enough knights to pursue Largest Army yet.

<plan>
1. Roll the dice to collect resources
2. Focus on building roads toward brick production (ideally connecting toward the 10 brick hex)
3. Save the Knight card for when the robber blocks my production or when I have 7+ cards
4. Long-term: establish a settlement near brick production, then consider upgrading settlements to cities
5. Monitor Red's expansion and use road placement to block critical paths if needed
</plan>

The optimal move is to roll the dice, conserving my Knight for a more strategically valuable moment.

# Game Analysis for Turn 9

I'll analyze my options carefully to determine the optimal move in this situation.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 2 VP from my 2 settlements
- Resources: 2 wood, 1 sheep (limited options)
- Development cards: 1 Knight card
- Red has 3 VP from 3 settlements and 7 hidden cards

## Option Analysis

### Option 0: Play Knight Card
**Pros:**
- Could disrupt Red who has 7 cards (they might be planning a significant build)
- Could steal a valuable resource from Red
- Would protect me from losing resources if I roll a 7 on my next turn
- Contributes toward Largest Army (2 VP) long-term

**Cons:**
- Knight cards are valuable defensive tools that I might need more urgently later
- I'm not in immediate danger of losing resources to the robber (only have 3 cards)
- With only 3 resources, I'm not in position to build anything significant after playing it

### Option 1: End Turn
**Pros:**
- Conserve the Knight card for when I have 7+ cards or to protect critical production
- Knight will be more valuable when I can immediately use stolen resources
- Roll again next turn to collect more resources before making moves

**Cons:**
- Red might build something significant with their 7 cards
- Miss opportunity to potentially disrupt Red's plans

## Strategic Consideration
My current production is poor, with settlements on only a 3 ore, 11 wheat, 9 sheep, and 8 wood. Notably, I have no brick production, which is essential for expansion. Playing the Knight now without a clear build plan doesn't advance my position significantly.

<plan>
1. Save Knight card for a more strategic moment (when I have 7+ cards or need specific resources)
2. Continue collecting resources through dice rolls
3. Focus on establishing roads toward brick production (10 or 9 brick hexes)
4. Build a settlement near brick production when possible
5. Consider upgrading to cities after securing brick access
6. Monitor Red's expansion and block critical paths if needed
</plan>

Based on this analysis, the optimal move is to end my turn and continue gathering resources for a meaningful build on my next turn.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

RESPONSE:
# Game Analysis for Turn 11

I need to decide whether to play my Knight card now or roll the dice. Let me think through this carefully.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I (Blue) have 2 VP (2 settlements)
- Red has 3 VP (3 settlements)
- I have limited resources: 2 Wood, 1 Sheep, 1 Ore
- Red has 7 cards (potentially at risk if a 7 is rolled)
- I have 1 Knight card I could play

## Knight Card Considerations
If I play the Knight card now:
1. Benefits:
   - Could steal a resource from Red
   - Could move the robber from the desert (where it's not affecting anyone) to block Red's production
   - Would start me toward Largest Army (2 VP)

2. Drawbacks:
   - I can't build anything with my current resources + whatever I might steal
   - Red's 7 cards are unknown - I might steal something not immediately useful
   - Knight cards are more valuable when protecting against a 7 roll with 7+ cards

## Roll Dice Considerations
If I roll the dice:
1. Benefits:
   - Could get resources I need for building
   - Get closer to my next strategic move (settlement/road)
   - Save Knight card for when I have 7+ cards or need specific resources

2. Drawbacks:
   - Risk of rolling a 7 (but I only have 4 cards, so no loss)
   - Red could get more resources if a favorable number is rolled

## Strategic Analysis
My current plan is to expand toward brick production. My resources (2 Wood, 1 Sheep, 1 Ore) aren't enough to build a road (1 Wood, 1 Brick) or anything else, even with a potential stolen card.

Playing the Knight card now would be suboptimal because:
1. I don't have enough resources to build anything meaningful right now
2. The Knight is more valuable later when I have 7+ cards or need to protect key resources
3. I'm not in immediate danger of losing to Red (only 3 VP)

<plan>
1. Roll the dice to collect more resources
2. Focus on building roads toward brick production (hexes with 10/9 values)
3. Build a settlement near brick production when possible
4. Consider upgrading to cities after securing brick access
5. Save Knight card for when I have 7+ cards or to steal a critical resource
6. Monitor Red's expansion and block if needed
</plan>

The optimal move is to roll the dice and continue resource collection toward my strategic goal of accessing brick production.

# Turn Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and my available options:

## Board Analysis
- I have 2 settlements: one at node 50 (produces wood) and one at node 12 (produces wheat, sheep, and ore)
- I have 2 roads total
- Red has 3 settlements producing a variety of resources, especially wheat, wood, and brick
- Red is ahead with 3 VPs vs my 2 VPs
- I have 2 wood, 2 sheep, 1 ore, and 1 Knight development card
- The robber is on desert (2, -1, -1), so it's not blocking any production

## Available Actions
1. Play Knight card - This would allow me to move the robber and steal a resource from Red
2. End turn - Pass to the next player

## Action Analysis

**Option 0: Play Knight Card**
- Advantages:
  - I can block one of Red's high-producing hexes
  - I can steal a resource from Red's 9 cards
  - I'll get credit toward Largest Army (need 3 Knights)
- Disadvantages:
  - I'm not in immediate danger of losing resources to the robber
  - I might want to save the Knight for when I have 7+ cards
  - Playing it now doesn't enable any immediate builds

**Option 1: End Turn**
- Advantages:
  - Save Knight card for when I really need it (resource protection or targeted stealing)
  - On my next turn, I'll likely get more resources from dice rolls
- Disadvantages:
  - Red continues to produce unhindered

## Strategic Evaluation

Looking at my resources (2 wood, 2 sheep, 1 ore), I can't build anything on this turn:
- Settlement needs 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat, 1 sheep
- Road needs 1 wood, 1 brick
- Development card needs 1 ore, 1 wheat, 1 sheep
- City upgrade needs 3 ore, 2 wheat

Right now, playing the Knight doesn't enable any builds. It's better to save it for when:
1. I need to protect resources from the robber (7+ cards)
2. I need to steal a specific resource to complete a build
3. I'm closer to getting Largest Army

<plan>
1. End turn now to save my Knight card
2. On next turn, aim to get brick for road building
3. Continue expansion toward brick production hexes (9/4/10 values)
4. Focus on settlement at nodes near brick, especially targeting ports
5. Long-term, secure longest road and/or push for city upgrades
</plan>

Since I can't make any productive builds this turn, and there's no urgent reason to play the Knight, the optimal choice is:

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 13 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

5. Long-term, secure longest road and/or push for city upgrades

# Game Analysis: Settlers of Catan

I'll carefully analyze the current game state and my available options to determine the optimal move.

## Current Situation
- I'm playing as BLUE with 2/10 victory points
- Resources: 1 Wood, 2 Sheep, 1 Ore
- I have 1 Knight development card
- It's my turn and I can either play my Knight card or roll the dice

## Option Analysis

### Option 0: Play Knight Card
If I play the Knight card now:
- Benefits:
  - Move robber from wheat hex (currently blocking 11 wheat) to a better position
  - Steal a resource from an opponent (RED has 6 cards)
  - Start building toward Largest Army (need 3 knights total)
- Drawbacks:
  - I don't have immediate building plans that would benefit from resource stealing
  - RED has hidden resources, so stealing is uncertain
  - Knight cards are valuable for protection when I have more resources later

### Option 1: Roll the Dice
If I roll the dice:
- With my settlements at nodes 50 and 12, I could potentially get:
  - Node 50: Wood on roll of 8
  - Node 12: Wheat on roll of 11 (currently blocked by robber), Sheep on roll of 9, Ore on roll of 3
- I can save my Knight card for more strategic use later
- On bad rolls, I could still trade using ports if needed
- My current resources aren't sufficient for any build, so gathering more is essential

## Strategic Assessment
My current position is limited with only 2 settlements. I need to expand by building roads and new settlements, particularly toward resource diversity and good production numbers.

The Knight card is most valuable when:
1. Protecting my resources from the robber (when I have 7+ cards)
2. Moving the robber off my high-value hexes
3. Stealing a specific needed resource for an immediate build
4. Building toward Largest Army as a late game strategy

None of these conditions are currently met. My priority should be gathering resources through rolling.

<plan>
1. Roll the dice to gather resources
2. Focus on building roads toward brick production (9/4 numbers)
3. Aim for a new settlement near brick to improve resource diversity
4. Save Knight card for protection or strategic use later
5. Long-term, evaluate paths to victory through expansion and possibly Largest Army
</plan>

After analyzing both options, rolling the dice is clearly the better choice. I need more resources before any strategic plays with the Knight card would be worthwhile.

# Game Analysis and Decision Making

Let me analyze my current situation in this game of Settlers of Catan:

## Current Game State
- I have 2 victory points (2 settlements)
- Resources: 1 wood, 2 sheep, 1 ore
- Development Cards: 1 Knight card
- Robber is currently on wheat hex (0, -1, 1) with dice value 11

## Analyzing My Options

**Option 0: Play Knight Card**
- Benefits:
  - Move the robber away from a productive hex (potentially helping my production)
  - Steal a resource from an opponent (RED has 7 cards)
  - Start working toward "Largest Army" (2 VP)
  - Protect my resources if I roll a 7 later

**Option 1: End Turn**
- Benefits:
  - Save the Knight card for later strategic use
  - Continue with my current plan to gather resources

## Strategic Considerations

Looking at RED's position:
- RED has 3 VP with 3 settlements in strong positions
- RED has 7 resource cards (vulnerable to robber)
- RED has good access to wood, wheat, and sheep

Looking at my position:
- I have limited resource production: my settlements are on low-probability numbers
- My resource diversity is poor (no brick production, limited wheat)
- I need to improve my resource income to have a chance at winning

Looking at development:
- Playing the Knight now would be the first knight played in the game
- I would need 2 more knights to secure Largest Army

## Decision Process

Given my current resource situation (1 wood, 2 sheep, 1 ore), I can't build anything this turn regardless of my choice. I need to decide whether playing the Knight now is beneficial:

1. Playing the Knight would allow me to:
   - Move the robber to a high-producing hex of RED (like the 8 wood or 6 wheat)
   - Steal a resource from RED (who has 7 cards)
   - Take a step toward Largest Army VP

2. Saving the Knight would allow me to:
   - Use it defensively if I collect more resources
   - Play it at a more strategic moment

Since I can't build anything with my current resources and RED seems to be in a stronger position with 7 resources, playing the Knight now makes strategic sense to potentially slow RED's progress and gain a resource I need.

<plan>
1. Play Knight card to move robber to RED's high-producing hex (wood 8 or wheat 6)
2. Steal a resource from RED, hopefully brick or wheat
3. Use my next few turns to build roads toward better resource production
4. Focus on getting a settlement near brick/wheat production
5. Continue collecting knights when possible to work toward Largest Army
6. Long-term aim for balanced city/settlement expansion strategy
</plan>

I'll play my Knight card to disrupt RED's resource collection and potentially gain a needed resource.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 13 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Play Knight card to move robber to RED's high-producing hex (wood 8 or wheat 6)
2. Steal a resource from RED, hopefully brick or wheat
3. Use my next few turns to build roads toward better resource production
4. Focus on getting a settlement near brick/wheat production
5. Continue collecting knights when possible to work toward Largest Army
6. Long-term aim for balanced city/settlement expansion strategy

# Analysis of Robber Placement Options

I need to determine the optimal hex for my robber placement that will maximize my chances of winning by disrupting my opponent's resource production while potentially gaining useful resources.

## Step 1: Analyze RED player's resource production
RED has settlements at nodes 14, 19, and 22 with the following production:
- Node 22: ⛏️5 (medium), 🌾6 (high), 🌲8 (high)
- Node 14: 🐑9 (medium), 🌲8 (high), 🧱9 (medium)
- Node 19: 🌲10 (low), 🐑5 (medium), 🌾6 (high)

RED is producing strongly in wheat (6), wood (8, 8, 10), and has decent brick production. They have 7 hidden resource cards.

## Step 2: Identify high-value robber targets
The most impactful hexes to block would be:
- 🌲8 (2, 0, -2) - Action 16: Blocks RED's wood production at node 22
- 🌲8 (-2, 0, 2) - Action 10: Blocks RED's wood production at node 14
- 🌾6 (1, 1, -2) - Action 15: Blocks RED's wheat production at node 19
- 🌾6 (1, 1, -2) - Action 15: Blocks RED's wheat production at node 22

## Step 3: Consider what resources I need
I have 1 wood, 2 sheep, 1 ore, but I'm lacking brick and wheat. I need to focus on expansion to better resource production, particularly brick and wheat.

## Step 4: Evaluate the best options

Option 15 (🌾6 hex): This blocks a high-probability wheat hex (6) that produces for TWO of RED's settlements (nodes 19 and 22). This is extremely high value as it significantly reduces RED's wheat income, which is essential for development cards and city upgrades.

Option 16 (🌲8 hex): This blocks a high-probability wood hex (8) that produces for RED's settlement at node 22. This would slow RED's expansion.

Option 10 (🌲8 hex): This blocks RED's wood production at node 14, also a high-probability hex (8).

## Step 5: Make decision based on strategic impact and resource theft opportunity
Placing the robber on the wheat 6 hex (Action 15) provides the highest value because:
1. It blocks a critical resource (wheat) on a high-probability number (6)
2. It impacts TWO of RED's settlements simultaneously
3. It gives me a chance to steal wheat, which I currently lack
4. Wheat is crucial for both RED and me for future development

<plan>
1. Move robber to the wheat 6 hex to block RED's wheat production from two settlements
2. Steal a resource from RED, hopefully wheat
3. Build roads toward brick/wheat production on my next turns
4. Aim to establish a settlement near better resource diversity
5. Continue collecting development cards when possible for knight cards or victory points
6. Focus on achieving balanced city/settlement expansion
</plan>

RESPONSE:
# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to place the robber optimally to:
1. Block high-value resource production from RED (my opponent)
2. Steal a useful resource
3. Disrupt RED's strategy without harming my own production

## Analyzing RED's Production
RED has strong production:
- At node 22: ⛏️5, 🌾6, 🌲8 (high-value wheat and wood)
- At node 14: 🐑9, 🌲8, 🧱9 (more wood)
- At node 19: 🌲10, 🐑5, 🌾6 (more wheat)

RED's strongest production is wheat (6) and wood (8, 10), which are crucial for cities and expansion.

## My Production
- At node 50: 🌲8 (wood)
- At node 12: 🌾11, 🐑9, ⛏️3

## Best Robber Placements

Looking at the options that allow me to steal from RED:
- [10] (-2, 0, 2): Blocks 🌲8 - This would block RED's wood production at node 14, hitting a high-probability (8) resource
- [15] (1, 1, -2): Blocks 🌾6 - This would block RED's wheat at nodes 19 and 22, hitting both settlements
- [16] (2, 0, -2): Blocks 🌲8 - This would block RED's wood at node 22

Option [15] is particularly strong as it blocks a 6 wheat hex that feeds TWO of RED's buildings (a city and a settlement).

## Strategic Considerations
- RED has 4 VP and appears to be in a strong position with diversified resources
- Blocking wheat is particularly effective as it's needed for both settlements and cities
- Stealing from RED gives me a chance to get a resource I need
- I should avoid blocking my own production

<plan>
1. Block RED's wheat production by placing robber on wheat 6 hex
2. Continue collecting resources for expansion toward better resource diversity
3. Build roads toward brick or ore production on future turns
4. Target development cards when possible for knights or hidden VP
5. Aim for balanced city and settlement development
</plan>

The optimal move is to place the robber on the wheat 6 hex (1, 1, -2), which blocks production for RED's city and settlement while allowing me to steal a resource.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section

# Game Analysis

I need to strategically place the robber to maximize my advantage while hindering my opponent.

## Current Situation Assessment
- RED is leading with 4 victory points vs my 2 points
- RED has 7 cards (vulnerable to robber if placed on the right hex)
- RED has strong production, especially on wheat 6 hex (⭐⭐⭐ production) and wood 8 hex (⭐⭐⭐ production)
- I need to focus on hindering RED while improving my own position

## Robber Placement Analysis
Looking at the options, I want to target RED's strongest production tiles:

1. RED's city at node 22 produces from three valuable tiles:
   - Wheat 6 [⭐⭐⭐] - already has the robber
   - Wood 8 [⭐⭐⭐]
   - Ore 5 [⭐⭐]

2. RED also has a settlement at node 19 producing from:
   - Wheat 6 [⭐⭐⭐] - already has the robber
   - Wood 10 [⭐]
   - Sheep 5 [⭐⭐]

3. RED has another settlement at node 14 producing from:
   - Wood 8 [⭐⭐⭐]
   - Sheep 9 [⭐⭐]
   - Brick 9 [⭐⭐]

## Strategic Decision
The best option is to target RED's wood 8 hex at (-2, 0, 2). This is option [11]:
- This blocks a ⭐⭐⭐ resource (high probability)
- Wood 8 is connected to RED's settlement at node 14
- Wood 8 is also connected to RED's city at node 22
- This allows me to steal a resource from RED
- This prevents RED from getting crucial wood for expansion

<plan>
1. Block RED's wood production by placing robber on wood 8 hex
2. Focus on expanding toward better ore and wheat production
3. Consider getting development cards for knights to keep the robber away from my resources
4. Target building at node 3 to improve my wheat production
5. Save resources for upgrading to a city when possible
</plan>

- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis: Robber Placement Decision

I need to analyze where to place the robber to maximize my advantage while hurting RED, who is significantly ahead at 5 victory points vs my 2 points.

## Analyzing RED's Production:
1. RED has two cities and one settlement
2. Key production: 
   - 🌲 Wood: Strong (8 at node 22, 8 at node 14)
   - 🌾 Wheat: Strong (6 at node 22 and 6 at node 19)
   - ⛏️ Ore: Decent (5 at node 22)
   - 🐑 Sheep: Decent (9 at node 14, 5 at node 19)
   - 🧱 Brick: Only at node 14 (9)

## Analyzing My Position:
- I need to expand significantly to catch up
- I have limited resources (1 wood, 2 sheep, 2 ore)
- My production is very weak compared to RED

## Robber Placement Strategy:
I should target RED's strongest resource production while potentially stealing a useful resource.

### Best Options:
- [16] Move robber to (2, 0, -2) and steal from RED
  - This blocks a wood 8 hex that RED produces from at node 22
  - Wood 8 is a high-probability and critical resource for RED's expansion
  - I can steal a resource from RED

- [5] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED
  - This blocks a wood 10 hex that RED produces from at node 19
  - Less valuable than the 8 hex, but still hurts RED's wood production

- [15] Move robber to (1, 1, -2) and steal from RED
  - This blocks a wheat 6 hex that RED produces from at nodes 19 and 22
  - Wheat is critical for city upgrades

- [6] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED
  - This blocks an ore 5 hex that RED produces from at node 22
  - Ore is critical for city upgrades and development cards

The wood 8 hex at (2, 0, -2) is particularly valuable to target because:
1. It's a high-probability number (8)
2. RED has a city producing from it at node 22
3. Wood is essential for road building and expansion
4. I can steal a resource from RED

<plan>
1. Block RED's wood production by placing robber on wood 8 hex (2, 0, -2)
2. Use my current resources to build roads toward better resource spots
3. Focus on acquiring ore and wheat to upgrade one of my settlements to a city
4. Try to connect my settlements with roads to work toward longest road
5. Consider buying a development card if I can't make immediate progress
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

# Game State Analysis

I need to analyze the current board situation and determine the optimal robber placement.

## Current State Assessment
- I have 2 victory points (2 settlements) while RED has 5 points (1 settlement, 2 cities)
- I have 1 wood, 2 sheep, 2 ore, and no brick or wheat
- RED is ahead and appears to be executing an effective city-focused strategy

## Robber Placement Goals
1. Disrupt RED's resource production (they're ahead)
2. Target their highest producing hexes
3. Steal a potentially useful resource
4. Avoid affecting my own production

## Key Hexes to Consider

Looking at RED's settlements and cities:
- RED has a city at node 22 producing from ⛏️5, 🌾6, and 🌲8 hexes
- RED has a city at node 19 producing from 🌲10, 🐑5, and 🌾6 hexes
- RED has a settlement at node 14 producing from 🐑9, 🌲8, and 🧱9 hexes

The highest value production for RED appears to be:
- Wood 8 at (2, 0, -2) - high probability and node 22 is a city
- Wood 10 at (0, 1, -1) - medium probability with city at node 19
- Wheat 6 at (1, 1, -2) - high probability with city at node 19

<plan>
1. Place robber on RED's wood 8 hex (2, 0, -2) to block a high-probability resource
2. Build roads toward valuable resource nodes, especially targeting wheat/ore
3. Aim to upgrade one settlement to a city once I gather 3 ore and 2 wheat
4. Work toward longest road as a path to victory
5. Consider development cards if I gather excess ore/wheat/sheep
</plan>

## Evaluating My Options

Action #16: Move robber to (2, 0, -2) and steal from RED
- This blocks a high-probability (8) wood hex
- The node 22 connected to this hex is a city, so it produces double resources
- Wood is valuable for RED's continued expansion
- I would get to steal a resource from RED

Action #15: Move robber to (1, 1, -2) and steal from RED
- This blocks a high-probability (6) wheat hex
- Connected to RED's city at node 19
- Wheat is critical for city upgrades
- I would get to steal a resource

Action #4: Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED
- This blocks a wood (10) hex
- Connected to RED's city at node 19
- Medium probability, but still valuable

Based on this analysis, my best option is to place the robber on RED's wood 8 hex (action #16). This is a high-probability number that produces for RED's city, making it an extremely valuable hex for them. Blocking this hex will significantly slow down RED's resource collection while also allowing me to steal a resource.

You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 37 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Place robber on RED's wood 8 hex (2, 0, -2) to block a high-probability resource
2. Build roads toward valuable resource nodes, especially targeting wheat/ore
3. Aim to upgrade one settlement to a city once I gather 3 ore and 2 wheat
4. Work toward longest road as a path to victory
5. Consider development cards if I gather excess ore/wheat/sheep

# Robber Placement Analysis

Let me carefully analyze my options for robber placement to maximize my strategic advantage.

## Understanding the Game State
- I have 2 VP (2 settlements)
- RED has 5 VP (1 settlement, 2 cities)
- RED is significantly ahead and my main competitor
- I have 2 wood, 1 sheep, 3 ore resources currently

## Robber Placement Considerations
1. Target high-value hexes for RED
2. Protect my own high-value hexes
3. Steal valuable resources from RED

## Examining RED's Production
- RED's settlements/cities produce:
  - Wood: 8 (⭐⭐⭐) at node 22, 8 (⭐⭐⭐) at node 14, 10 (⭐) at node 19
  - Wheat: 6 (⭐⭐⭐) at node 22, 6 (⭐⭐⭐) at node 19
  - Ore: 5 (⭐⭐) at node 22
  - Brick: 9 (⭐⭐) at node 14
  - Sheep: 9 (⭐⭐) at node 14, 5 (⭐⭐) at node 19

## Best Robber Placements
Looking at RED's high-value hexes:
- Option [16]: Target (2, 0, -2) - RED's wood 8 hex connected to node 22
  * Blocks a high-probability 8 (⭐⭐⭐) wood production
  * Settlement at node 22 is a city, making this even more impactful
  * Allows me to steal from RED

- Option [15]: Target (1, 1, -2) - RED's wheat 6 hex connected to node 19
  * Blocks a high-probability 6 (⭐⭐⭐) wheat production
  * Settlement at node 19 is a city, making this very impactful
  * Allows me to steal from RED

- Option [5]: Target (1, 0, -1) - RED's ore 5 hex connected to node 22
  * Blocks RED's only ore production
  * Settlement at node 22 is a city
  * Allows me to steal from RED

## Strategic Decision
Option [16] is optimal because:
1. It targets RED's high-probability wood production (8)
2. Wood is critical for RED's expansion via roads
3. This aligns with my current plan to slow RED's expansion
4. Stealing a resource from RED could help me build my next road

<plan>
1. Place robber on RED's wood 8 hex (2, 0, -2) to block high-probability resource
2. Use my current resources toward building a city (I have 3 ore already, need 2 wheat)
3. Focus on expanding toward wheat/ore production
4. Work toward longest road while building cities
5. Consider development cards if excess ore/wheat/sheep are acquired
</plan>

# Game Analysis

I need to choose where to move the robber. Let me analyze the current game state and best robber placement:

## Current Situation
- RED has 6 VPs with 3 cities
- I (BLUE) have only 2 VPs with 2 settlements
- RED is clearly ahead and my main competitor
- My resources: 1 wood and 3 sheep (not enough for immediate building)
- The robber is currently on (0, -1, 1), a wheat 11 hex

## Robber Placement Strategy
I should place the robber on the most productive hex for RED that doesn't affect me. Looking at RED's buildings:

- RED has a city at node 22 that produces ore 5, wheat 6, and wood 8
- RED has a city at node 14 that produces sheep 9, wood 8, and brick 9
- RED has a city at node 19 that produces wood 10, sheep 5, and wheat 6

The most valuable hex for RED is the wood 8 at (2, 0, -2) since:
1. It has probability ⭐⭐⭐ (high frequency)
2. Two of RED's cities produce from it (nodes 14 and 22)
3. Wood is crucial for road building and expansion
4. This hex doesn't affect any of my settlements

## Other Options to Consider
Option 10 (wood 8 at -2, 0, 2) might seem good, but that would only block one of RED's cities.
Option 15 (wheat 6 at 1, 1, -2) would block wheat from two of RED's cities, but wheat 6 is slightly less valuable than wood 8.

<plan>
1. Place robber on RED's wood 8 hex (2, 0, -2) to block high-probability resource production from two cities
2. Use stolen resource to help build toward my next priority
3. Focus on expanding toward ore/wheat production to build cities
4. Work toward longest road while building settlements at strategic locations
5. Buy development cards when excess ore/wheat/sheep are available
</plan>

Therefore, the optimal choice is action 16 - moving the robber to (2, 0, -2) and stealing from RED.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for BLUE Player

I'll analyze the current game state and make a decision based on my strategic options.

## Current Situation Assessment
- I have 2 VP (both from settlements) vs RED's 7 VP (1 settlement + 3 cities)
- Resources: 4 Wood, 1 Sheep, 1 Ore
- I'm far behind with only 2 settlements and 2 roads vs RED's extensive network
- RED is 3 points away from winning, making them a serious threat

## Resource Analysis
- My current resources aren't sufficient for any immediate build (need brick for roads/settlements)
- 4 Wood is abundant but not useful alone
- Need to convert wood into more useful resources

## Strategic Options

1. **End Turn (Action 0):** Not recommended as I'd waste my wood resources and make no progress.

2. **Trade Options (Actions 1-4):** 
   - Trading 4:1 is inefficient, but I need to convert wood into something useful
   - Option 2: Trade for Ore - I already have 1 Ore, so getting another could set up for development card
   - Option 4: Trade for Brick - Would help with road building, which is critical for expansion
   - Option 3: Trade for Wheat - Could combine with Ore for development card or future city upgrade
   - Option 1: Trade for Sheep - Less valuable as I already have 1 Sheep

## Strategic Priorities
1. I need to expand quickly to catch up to RED
2. Building roads and settlements requires Brick
3. Development cards could provide Knights (defense) or hidden VPs

Looking at my current position, I need to focus on expansion given how far behind I am. Brick is the critical resource I'm missing for any expansion. Trading 4 Wood for 1 Brick would allow me to build a road next turn (with future wood production), setting up for settlement expansion.

<plan>
1. Trade wood for brick to enable road building
2. Focus on expanding toward ore/wheat hexes for future city development
3. Try to establish longest road (2 VP) as part of my expansion strategy
4. Use development cards opportunistically when I have resources
5. Target settlement locations that can block RED's expansion
</plan>

The most strategic choice is to trade for brick as it enables immediate expansion on my next turn.

# Game Analysis for Turn 57

I need to carefully analyze my position and options as BLUE player. Let me assess the game state:

## Current Situation
- I have 2/10 Victory Points (2 settlements)
- Resources: 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Sheep, 1 Ore
- RED is at 7/10 VP with 3 cities and 1 settlement
- RED is very close to winning, and has a strong production engine
- I need to make strategic progress this turn since I can build a road

## Board Analysis
- My settlements are at nodes 12 and 50, on opposite sides of the board
- Node 12 produces Wheat(11), Sheep(9), and Ore(3) - decent but low probability
- Node 50 produces only Wood(8) - good production with probability 5/36
- My expansion options are limited and I need to choose carefully

## Action Options
I have exactly the resources needed to build one road (1 Wood, 1 Brick). Let me evaluate each road option:

### Road at (3, 4)
Would extend from my node 3 area, but this isn't where my settlement is. Not immediately useful.

### Road at (48, 49)
Not directly connected to my existing roads.

### Road at (50, 51)
Extends from my settlement at node 50 toward node 51. This would work toward potentially better hexes and ports.

### Road at (22, 49)
Not directly connected to my existing roads.

### Road at (12, 13)
Extends from my settlement at node 12 toward node 13. This node connects to Ore(3) and Wood(8) hexes.

### Road at (2, 3)
Would extend from node 2, but I don't have a settlement there.

### Road at (11, 12)
Extends from my settlement at node 12 toward node 11. This connects to Wood(12), Wheat(11), and Ore(3) hexes.

## Strategic Decision
I need to update my plan given RED's commanding lead:

<plan>
1. Build roads from my settlements toward high-value building spots
2. Focus on creating settlement opportunities that can access ore/wheat for city upgrades
3. Try to secure longest road (2VP) to catch up with RED
4. Tactically interfere with RED's expansion where possible
5. Focus on resource diversity to enable consistent building
</plan>

Looking at my options, I should build a road that:
1. Extends from my existing settlements
2. Moves toward valuable resources
3. Creates potential for future settlements
4. Could lead to longest road points

The two best options are road (12, 13) and road (50, 51).

Road (12, 13) extends from my settlement at node 12 toward a hex with Ore (which I need for cities) and Wood. This would help me gain access to more resources and potentially block RED's expansion.

Road (50, 51) extends from my settlement at node 50, but the neighboring hexes are less clear from the information provided.

Between these options, road (12, 13) seems more strategic as it provides access to ore production which I'll need for future city upgrades, and it's in an area where RED already has some presence (node 14), allowing me to potentially interfere with their expansion.

Therefore, I choose to build a road at edge (12, 13).

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Analyzing Robber Placement Strategy

I need to strategically place the robber to maximize my position while hindering RED, who is significantly ahead with 7 VP compared to my 2 VP.

## Step 1: Identify High-Value Targets
Looking at RED's settlements and cities:
- RED has cities at nodes 14, 19, and 22, producing high-value resources
- Their city at node 22 produces from ⛏️5(⭐⭐), 🌾6(⭐⭐⭐), 🌲8(⭐⭐⭐) - extremely strong production
- Their city at node 19 produces from 🌲10(⭐), 🐑5(⭐⭐), 🌾6(⭐⭐⭐) - also very strong

## Step 2: Analyze Hexes with Highest Impact
The best targets would be:
1. 🌾6 (1, 1, -2) - blocks high-value wheat from RED's cities (19 and 22)
2. 🌲8 (2, 0, -2) - blocks high-value wood from RED's city (22)
3. ⛏️5 (1, 0, -1) - blocks ore from RED's settlement (1) and city (22)

## Step 3: Consider Stealing Potential
I can steal from RED in several positions, which is important since they have 5 cards.

## Step 4: Evaluate My Own Production
I need to avoid blocking my own production at:
- Node 12: 🌾11(⭐), 🐑9(⭐⭐), ⛏️3(⭐)
- Node 50: 🌲8(⭐⭐⭐)

## Step 5: Make Strategic Decision
The best option is to target one of RED's key production hexes:
- Option [15]: Move robber to (1, 1, -2) and steal from RED
  * This blocks the 🌾6 hex which is crucial for TWO of RED's cities
  * This is a triple-star wheat hex, severely limiting their city-building capability
  * I can also steal a resource from RED

<plan>
1. Disrupt RED's wheat production to slow their city development
2. Focus on expanding my road network toward valuable spots (like ports)
3. Aim to reach node 23 which could connect me to the 3:1 port at 52/53
4. Continue building settlements to catch up in points
5. Target development cards for knights to potentially secure largest army

# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to carefully analyze where to place the robber to maximize my benefit while hampering RED who is dangerously close to winning with 9 VP.

## Analyzing the Board State
- RED has 9 VP and only needs 1 more to win
- RED has 3 cities and 1 settlement, plus longest road bonus (+2 VP)
- I'm far behind with only 2 VP from my 2 settlements
- RED likely has plans to build another settlement or buy a victory point development card

## Robber Placement Strategy
Looking at RED's production:
- At node 22: ⛏️5[⭐⭐], 🌾6[⭐⭐⭐], 🌲8[⭐⭐⭐] - Very high production
- At node 14: 🐑9[⭐⭐], 🌲8[⭐⭐⭐], 🧱9[⭐⭐] - Strong wood production
- At node 19: 🌲10[⭐], 🐑5[⭐⭐], 🌾6[⭐⭐⭐] - Strong wheat production
- At node 1: 🐑2, 🐑6[⭐⭐⭐], ⛏️5[⭐⭐] - Good sheep and ore

The highest value targets are:
1. Hex (1, 1, -2) - 🌾6[⭐⭐⭐] - Already has robber
2. Hex (2, 0, -2) - 🌲8[⭐⭐⭐] - Action 16
3. Hex (-2, 0, 2) - 🌲8[⭐⭐⭐] - Action 11

## Optimal Robber Placement Decision
Since RED is close to winning, I need to target their most productive hex. The robber is already on one wheat hex (1,1,-2), but RED still has high wood production.

Option 16 targets the 8-value wood hex at (2,0,-2) which:
- Disrupts one of RED's critical resources (wood)
- Allows me to steal a resource from RED
- Blocks a high probability number (8)
- Impacts RED's city at node 22 (which produces from this hex)

<plan>
1. Disrupt RED's wood production to slow their expansion
2. Build a road from node 50 toward node 49 to access the 3:1 port
3. Trade resources efficiently using that port once reached
4. Focus on getting another settlement and then upgrading to cities
5. Consider development cards if I can secure ore and wheat production
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis: Turn 67 for Blue Player

Let me carefully evaluate the current game state and my options:

## Current Game State Analysis
- I have: 2 Wood, 2 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 3 Ore
- RED has 9 VP (3 cities = 6 VP, 1 settlement = 1 VP, longest road = 2 VP)
- RED is just 1 point away from winning
- I only have 2 VP (2 settlements)
- The robber is on a wood hex (2, 0, -2) which produces an 8
- My options are limited: I can either buy a development card or end my turn

## Option 1: Buy Development Card (1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore)
- Potential outcomes:
  - Victory Point card: Immediate hidden VP (25% chance)
  - Knight: Would give me ability to move robber and potentially disrupt RED's strong production (40% chance)
  - Year of Plenty/Monopoly/Road Building: Would help me gain resources or build faster (35% chance)
- This would leave me with: 2 Wood, 1 Sheep, 0 Wheat, 2 Ore
- This is my only real action to make progress this turn

## Option 0: End Turn
- Make no progress this turn
- Keep all my resources for next turn
- Risk losing half if a 7 is rolled and I still have 8 resources
- RED will likely win on their next turn anyway

## Strategic Assessment
RED is about to win with 9 points. My only real chance is to slow them down while building toward victory myself. A development card offers the best chance at this - it could be a direct VP, or a knight that lets me disrupt RED's production.

I need to pivot my strategy since RED is so close to winning:

<plan>
1. Buy development cards aggressively for potential VPs and knights
2. Use knights to disrupt RED's strongest production
3. Trade efficiently at ports to build another settlement ASAP
4. If I get Road Building or good trades, expand toward node 49 for the 3:1 port
5. Focus on upgrading to cities if I get good ore/wheat production
</plan>

Given RED's imminent victory, I must take action rather than ending my turn with no progress.

# Game Analysis for Catan Turn 69

I need to decide between playing a Knight card now or rolling the dice. Let me analyze the current game state to make an optimal decision:

## Current Situation
- RED has 9/10 victory points (3 cities, 1 settlement, longest road) and is 1 point away from winning
- I (BLUE) have only 2/10 victory points (2 settlements) and am far behind
- I have 2 WOOD, 1 SHEEP, 2 ORE, and 1 unplayed KNIGHT card
- The robber is currently on a WOOD hex (2,0,-2) with value 8, which is a high-production hex

## Option Analysis:

### Option 0: Play Knight Card
**Pros:**
- Can move the robber off the valuable wood hex and onto one of RED's productive hexes
- Can steal a resource from RED, potentially disrupting their final turn
- Might prevent RED from winning on their next turn if they need specific resources
- Could start building toward "largest army" (I'd have 2 knights played)

**Cons:**
- Delays my own resource collection this turn
- Using the knight now means I won't have it for defense later

### Option 1: Roll Dice
**Pros:**
- Could get more resources to build with immediately
- Saves the knight for a more critical moment
- If I roll a 7, I still get to move the robber and steal

**Cons:**
- RED is one point away from winning, so delaying disruption is risky
- Rolling anything but a 7 means the robber stays where it is
- Even with more resources, my build options are limited given my current position

## Strategic Considerations:
- RED is at 9/10 VP and almost certain to win on their next turn unless disrupted
- My priority must be to interfere with RED's winning plan
- My own path to victory is very long - I need 8 more points, so immediate defensive play is more important

## Decision Logic:
Given RED's overwhelming advantage (9/10 VP), my best chance is to be disruptive. Playing the Knight now allows me to:
1. Move the robber to one of RED's high-value hexes (likely the 6 wheat or another 8)
2. Steal a resource that might be critical to their winning plan
3. Begin accumulating knights toward largest army (though this is a longer-term goal)

<plan>
1. Play Knight to disrupt RED's resource production and steal a resource
2. Target RED's wheat-6 hex which produces for two of their cities
3. Focus on expanding toward node 49 to secure a 3:1 port
4. Continue buying development cards when possible for knights/victory points
5. Look for opportunities to build cities when ore/wheat are available
</plan>

In this critical situation with an opponent on the verge of winning, defense is more important than my own resource generation. I need to act now with the knight.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Robber Placement

I need to strategically place the robber to hinder RED who is very close to winning with 9/10 victory points, while maximizing my own advantage.

## Current Game State Summary
- RED has 9 points: 3 cities (6 VP), 1 settlement (1 VP), and longest road (2 VP)
- I (BLUE) have only 2 points from 2 settlements and am far behind
- RED has multiple high-producing hexes (8s and 6s)
- I need to significantly disrupt RED's progress to have any chance

## Analyzing Robber Placement Options

Let me evaluate the high-value targets:

### Critical Production Hexes for RED:
- (1, 1, -2): 🌾6 - Produces for RED's cities at nodes 19 and 22
- (1, 0, -1): ⛏️5 - Produces for RED's settlement at node 1 and city at node 22
- (0, 1, -1): 🌲10 - Produces for RED's city at node 19
- (-1, 0, 1): 🐑9 - Produces for RED's city at node 14
- (-2, 0, 2): 🌲8 - Produces for RED's city at node 14

The most impactful would be targeting RED's wheat-6 hex (1, 1, -2) for several reasons:
1. It produces for TWO of RED's cities (high-value buildings)
2. Wheat is critical for building cities and development cards
3. This hex has a high roll probability (6)
4. I can steal a resource from RED

Option [16] corresponds to moving the robber to (1, 1, -2) and stealing from RED.

## Strategic Reasoning
- Targeting wheat production is particularly effective as it's needed for both cities and development cards
- RED likely needs just one more victory point to win, so disrupting their ability to build is critical
- Stealing a resource provides immediate value to me
- This hex produces for two cities, making it more impactful than targeting a hex that only affects one building

<plan>
1. Disrupt RED's wheat production by placing robber on the wheat-6 hex (1, 1, -2)
2. Use my ore to buy development cards for potential victory points or knights
3. Focus on building toward node 49 for the 3:1 port to improve my trading options
4. Work toward getting a city with my ore and wheat when available
5. Consider how to block RED's potential expansion with strategic road placement

❓ Select action by number (0-4):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state and make the optimal decision.

## Game State Analysis

- I (BLUE) only have 2 VP, while RED has 9 VP (just 1 away from winning)
- RED has Longest Road (2 VP) and 3 cities (6 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP)
- I have 2 settlements (2 VP) and 2 knights played but not enough for Largest Army
- My resources: 4 Wood, 1 Sheep, 1 Ore
- RED has 6 hidden cards

## Strategic Considerations

RED is just 1 VP away from winning. They could win on their next turn by:
- Building another settlement
- Buying a development card that could be a VP card
- Getting enough knights for Largest Army

My available actions are limited to:
- End turn [0]
- Maritime trade options (all with 4:1 ratio) [1-4]

With my current resources, I can't build anything significant. My only options are to trade or end my turn.

## Options Analysis

1. Trade 4 Wood for 1 Sheep [1]:
   - Would give me 2 Sheep, 1 Ore - still can't build anything useful

2. Trade 4 Wood for 1 Ore [2]:
   - Would give me 2 Ore, 1 Sheep - can't build any meaningful structure

3. Trade 4 Wood for 1 Wheat [3]:
   - Would give me 1 Wheat, 1 Sheep, 1 Ore - can't build anything meaningful

4. Trade 4 Wood for 1 Brick [4]:
   - Would give me 1 Brick, 1 Sheep, 1 Ore - can build one road, but this doesn't immediately help

5. End turn [0]:
   - Preserve resources for next turn when I might get better production

<plan>
1. Save resources for potential development card (need more ore and wheat)
2. Hope to get lucky with rolls to prevent RED from winning
3. Focus on acquiring more ore and wheat to buy development cards
4. Look for opportunities to build roads toward the 3:1 port at node 49
5. Try to disrupt RED's production when possible with future robber placements
</plan>

Trading away 4 wood for any single resource isn't efficient at a 4:1 ratio, and none of the possible trades enable me to make a meaningful build. The best option is to preserve my resources for potential development card purchases or builds on future turns.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan - Turn 73

I need to carefully analyze the current game state and make the best strategic decision.

## Game State Analysis:
- RED is at 9/10 VP (very close to winning) with 3 cities, 1 settlement, and longest road
- I (BLUE) have only 2/10 VP with 2 settlements and no clear path to victory
- Resources: I have 4 wood, 2 sheep, 1 ore, but lack wheat and brick
- The robber is on a wheat hex (0,-1,1) with value 11

## Current Situation Assessment:
RED is one point away from winning, while I'm far behind at only 2 points. This is a very challenging position. My immediate concern is preventing RED from winning on their next turn, but my options are limited.

## Resource Analysis:
With my current resources (4 wood, 2 sheep, 1 ore), I cannot:
- Build a settlement (need brick + wood + wheat + sheep)
- Build a city (need 3 ore + 2 wheat)
- Buy a development card (need ore + wheat + sheep)

## Available Actions:
0. End turn (do nothing)
1-4. Trade 4 wood for another resource (sheep, ore, wheat, or brick)

## Decision Process:
Since RED is about to win and I have limited options, I need to maximize my chances of making progress next turn.

Trading 4 wood for 1 of another resource is inefficient but necessary. What should I prioritize?
- Ore and wheat are my most needed resources for development cards and cities
- I already have 1 ore, so getting wheat would allow me to be just 1 resource (sheep) away from a development card
- A development card could give me a Victory Point or Knight (for potential Largest Army)

<plan>
1. Trade 4 wood for 1 wheat now
2. Hope for good rolls to get the remaining resources needed for a development card
3. Look for opportunities to disrupt RED by moving the robber when possible
4. Focus on development cards as my primary path to points, since I'm too far behind for settlement/road strategy
5. If I get Knights, work toward Largest Army (2 VP) as I already have 2 played Knights
</plan>

After analyzing my options, I should trade 4 wood for 1 wheat (action #3), which positions me closer to buying a development card on my next turn if I get lucky with resource production.

# Game State Analysis

I'll analyze the current state of the game to determine the optimal move:

## Current Position
- I (BLUE) have only 2 VP from my 2 settlements, far behind RED who has 9 VP
- RED has 3 cities (6 VP), 1 settlement (1 VP), and Longest Road (2 VP)
- RED is just 1 VP away from winning

## My Resources
- 2 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore
- This is exactly what I need for a development card

## Strategic Assessment
RED is extremely close to winning with 9 VP. They could win by:
1. Building another settlement (requires brick + wood + sheep + wheat)
2. Buying a development card that gives a VP (requires sheep + wheat + ore)
3. Playing a VP development card they might already have

Given that RED has 11 hidden resource cards, they likely have or can easily obtain the resources needed to win on their next turn.

## Available Actions
1. Buy a development card (1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore)
0. End my turn

<plan>
1. Buy a development card immediately - it's my only chance to either:
   a) Get a Victory Point card to inch closer
   b) Get a Knight to potentially secure Largest Army (I already have 2 played)
   c) Get a special card (Monopoly, Year of Plenty, Road Building) to improve position
2. If I get a Knight, play it immediately on my next turn to disrupt RED
3. If I get Monopoly or Year of Plenty, use it strategically to either get resources for a settlement or block RED
4. Continue focusing on development cards as my primary path since I'm too far behind in settlement/city strategy
</plan>

## Decision
The strategic choice is clear. I must buy a development card, as it's my only chance to:
1. Potentially get a VP card directly
2. Get a Knight to work toward Largest Army (already have 2)
3. Get a utility card to improve my position

Furthermore, ending my turn without using my perfectly matched resources would waste this opportunity.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 0 | Player: BLUE | Action: BUILD_INITIAL_SETTLEMENT

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Buy a development card immediately - it's my only chance to either:
   a) Get a Victory Point card to inch closer
   b) Get a Knight to potentially secure Largest Army (I already have 2 played)
   c) Get a special card (Monopoly, Year of Plenty, Road Building) to improve position
2. If I get a Knight, play it immediately on my next turn to disrupt RED
3. If I get Monopoly or Year of Plenty, use it strategically to either get resources for a settlement or block RED
4. Continue focusing on development cards as my primary path since I'm too far behind in settlement/city strategy

# Initial Settlement Placement Analysis

I'm placing my first settlement, which is a critical strategic decision that will shape my entire game. Let me analyze the board systematically to find the optimal placement.

## Step 1: Identify high-value number tiles (6 and 8)
- 🌾Wheat 6 at (-1, 0, 1) - nodes 3,4,12,13,14,15
- 🐑Sheep 6 at (0, 1, -1) - nodes 0,5,16,19,20,21
- 🧱Brick 8 at (2, -2, 0) - nodes 7,8,24,25,26,27
- 🌲Wood 8 at (0, 0, 0) - nodes 0,1,2,3,4,5

## Step 2: Identify intersections with multiple high-probability resources
The best spot would be one connecting multiple high-probability numbers (6/8) on different resources:
- Node 3 connects 🌾Wheat 6, 🌲Wood 8, and 🌾Wheat 4
- Node 0 connects 🌲Wood 8, 🐑Sheep 6, and 🧱Brick 10

## Step 3: Consider resource diversity
For my first settlement, I want to ensure access to diverse resources with a focus on important resources like ore and wheat for city upgrades.

Node 3 gives:
- 🌾Wheat 6 (high probability)
- 🌾Wheat 3 (low probability)
- 🌲Wood 8 (high probability)

Node 0 gives:
- 🌲Wood 8 (high probability)
- 🐑Sheep 6 (high probability)
- 🧱Brick 10 (medium probability)

## Step 4: Consider expansion potential
- Node 3 allows expansion toward ore sources and ports
- Node 0 allows expansion toward more diverse resources

## Step 5: Consider ports proximity
Node 0 has better access to multiple port options in the future.

## Decision
After careful analysis, I'll choose Node 0 because:
1. It provides access to two high-probability numbers (6 and 8)
2. It gives me three different resources (wood, sheep, brick)
3. It provides excellent expansion opportunities
4. Wood and brick will help with early expansion
5. This position gives access to several potential port locations

<plan>
1. Place first settlement at node 0 (connecting Wood 8, Sheep 6, Brick 10)
2. For my second settlement, look for a position with good ore and wheat production
3. Early game: expand toward valuable port locations
4. Mid-game: focus on city upgrades and development cards
5. Late game: secure longest road or largest army based on resource availability

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:

- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex

RESPONSE:
# Analyzing My First Road Placement

I need to choose the best initial road from my settlement at node 0, which is connected to Wood 8, Sheep 6, and Brick 10 - an excellent starting position with two high-probability resources.

Let me analyze each road option:

## Option 0: Road at edge (0, 1)
- Direction: Toward node 1
- Node 1 connects to: Wood 8, Ore 3, Brick 10
- This leads toward the ore resource which I currently lack
- This path could eventually lead to the ore 2:1 port via nodes 23→52

## Option 1: Road at edge (0, 20)
- Direction: Toward node 20
- Node 20 connects to: Sheep 6, Brick 10, Wood 11
- This leads toward a duplicate brick resource and a low-probability wood (11)
- This path could eventually lead to the 3:1 general port (nodes 48, 49)

## Option 2: Road at edge (0, 5)
- Direction: Toward node 5
- Node 5 connects to: Wood 8, Wheat 3, Sheep 6
- This leads toward wheat which I currently lack
- This path could eventually connect to the wheat 2:1 port via nodes 16→21→43→44

## Strategic Analysis
For my initial road, I should prioritize:
1. Leading toward resources I don't yet have (ore and wheat)
2. Positioning for future settlement expansion
3. Considering port access for later game

My second settlement will need to secure ore and wheat. Looking at the options:
- Option 0 gives access to ore
- Option 2 gives access to wheat
- Option 1 doesn't provide any new resources

<plan>
1. Place first settlement at node 0 (connecting Wood 8, Sheep 6, Brick 10)
2. Build first road toward node 1 to gain access to ore
3. For my second settlement, look for a high-probability wheat location
4. Early game: build 1-2 more settlements to secure all resources
5. Mid-game: focus on city upgrades at my high-production settlements
6. Late-game: evaluate longest road vs. development card strategy based on resource production
</plan>

Option 0 is optimal as it provides access to ore (which I need) and maintains flexibility for future expansion. This aligns with my strategy of securing all five resources between my two initial settlements.

# Analysis of Second Settlement Placement

I need to analyze the optimal placement for my second initial settlement to maximize my chances of winning. This is a critical decision that will shape the entire game.

## Current Situation
- My first settlement is at node 0: produces Wood (8), Sheep (6), and Brick (10)
- I have strong Wood (8) and Sheep (6) production (both high-probability numbers)
- I need to diversify my resources, particularly gaining access to Wheat and Ore

## Key Considerations for Second Settlement
1. Resource diversity - I need Wheat and Ore
2. High-probability numbers (6/8/5/9) on resources I don't already have
3. Good expansion potential
4. Access to a valuable port if possible
5. Avoiding close proximity to opponents

## Evaluating Top Options

### Node 12
- Resources: Wheat (4), Sheep (12), Brick (4)
- Pros: Gives me Wheat, good expansion potential
- Cons: Low-probability numbers (4 and 12), already have Sheep and Brick

### Node 14
- Resources: Wheat (6), Brick (4), Ore (11)
- Pros: High-probability Wheat (6), adds Ore, access to Wood port nearby
- Cons: Low-probability Ore (11)

### Node 17
- Resources: Wheat (3), Ore (11), Wood (10)
- Pros: Adds Ore, near Wood port
- Cons: Low-probability numbers (3, 11)

### Node 22
- Resources: Wood (11), Brick (10), Ore (2)
- Pros: Adds Ore, decent expansion potential
- Cons: Very low-probability numbers (11, 2)

### Node 25
- Resources: Brick (8), Ore port access
- Pros: High-probability Brick (8), direct access to Ore port
- Cons: Only one resource hex, lacks Wheat

### Node 26
- Resources: Brick (8), Ore port access
- Similar to node 25

### Node 39
- Resources: Wood (10), Ore (11), Wood port access
- Pros: Adds Ore, direct access to Wood port
- Cons: Low-probability numbers, already have Wood

### Node 14 (Detailed Analysis)
- Resources: Wheat (6), Brick (4), Ore (11)
- Gives high-probability Wheat (6) which I need
- Adds Ore (though low probability)
- Positions me to expand toward Wheat (5) and Wood (10)
- Access to Wood port nearby (beneficial since I have Wood 8 production)
- Far from opponents' settlements

<plan>
1. Place second settlement at node 14 (connecting Wheat 6, Brick 4, Ore 11)
2. Build road toward the Wood port (nodes 38-39)
3. Early game: build settlement at node 39 to secure Wood port
4. Also expand toward higher-probability Ore if possible
5. Mid-game: focus on city upgrades at my high-production settlements
6. Late-game: evaluate longest road vs. development card strategy
</plan>

After careful analysis, node 14 offers the best combination of resource diversity (gaining Wheat and Ore), high-probability number on Wheat (6), expansion potential, and access to a Wood port which synergizes with my strong Wood production. This settlement completes my resource diversity and positions me well for early growth.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 2 | Player: BLUE | Action: BUILD_INITIAL_ROAD

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Place second settlement at node 14 (connecting Wheat 6, Brick 4, Ore 11)
2. Build road toward the Wood port (nodes 38-39)
3. Early game: build settlement at node 39 to secure Wood port
4. Also expand toward higher-probability Ore if possible
5. Mid-game: focus on city upgrades at my high-production settlements
6. Late-game: evaluate longest road vs. development card strategy

# Game State Analysis for Initial Road Placement

I'm currently in the initial placement phase where I'm placing my second road after my second settlement. I need to analyze the best road placement option based on my settlements and future expansion strategy.

## Current Settlements
- Settlement at node 0: produces Wood(8), Sheep(6), Brick(10)
- Settlement at node 24: produces Brick(8), Sheep(9)

## Resource Analysis
Between my two settlements, I'm producing:
- Wood (8) - high probability
- Sheep (6, 9) - good probabilities
- Brick (8, 10) - good probabilities
- Missing: Wheat and Ore (crucial for city upgrades)

## Road Options
[0] Edge (24, 53): Heads toward the Sheep(9) and Wheat port
[1] Edge (24, 25): Heads toward the Ore port
[2] Edge (7, 24): Connects toward the center/Wood area

## Strategic Considerations

For each option:

**Option 0 (24, 53):**
- Pros: Moves toward a Wheat port (valuable since I don't produce wheat)
- Cons: I already produce plenty of sheep; doesn't advance toward new resource types

**Option 1 (24, 25):**
- Pros: Moves toward the Ore port (I don't produce ore yet)
- Cons: Might be a longer path to actual settlement locations

**Option 2 (7, 24):**
- Pros: Moves toward the center of the board with more expansion options
- Cons: Doesn't directly target a specific missing resource or port

Considering my current settlement at node 24 produces Brick(8) and Sheep(9), I should expand toward resources I don't have (Wheat and Ore) or ports that let me trade for them.

Looking at the board, Option 1 (24, 25) moves me toward the Ore port, which addresses one of my missing resources. This aligns with my long-term strategy to upgrade settlements to cities (needing Ore and Wheat).

<plan>
1. Build initial road from node 24 to 25, moving toward the Ore port
2. Next steps: Secure another road to reach the Ore port at nodes 25-26
3. Early game: Build settlement at a location producing Ore and/or Wheat
4. Mid-game: Use the Ore port to acquire Ore efficiently for city upgrades
5. Continue to evaluate expansion toward Wheat-producing areas
6. Late-game: Evaluate longest road vs. development card strategy based on resource production
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I choose:

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

I'll analyze the current game state and available options to determine the optimal move.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 2 settlements: one at node 0 and one at node 24
- Resources: 1 🌲WOOD, 2 🧱BRICK, 1 🐑SHEEP
- My initial plan involved building roads toward the Ore port at nodes 25-26

## Available Actions Analysis
I can either end my turn or build a road using my 1 wood and 1 brick.

Let me evaluate each road building option:

1. Road at (24, 53): 
   - Connects my settlement at node 24 to node 53
   - Node 53 is part of the Wheat port (52, 53) and adjacent to Sheep hex
   - Moves toward resources but not directly to ideal settlement spots

2. Road at (1, 2):
   - Extends from node 1 (adjacent to my settlement at node 0)
   - Leads toward ore and wheat hexes
   - Potentially valuable for resource diversity

3. Road at (0, 20):
   - Extends from my settlement at node 0
   - Moves toward wood and sheep resources
   - Not ideal for resource diversity since I already produce these

4. Road at (0, 5):
   - Extends from my settlement at node 0
   - Leads toward sheep resources
   - Not an optimal direction for expansion

5. Road at (1, 6):
   - Extends from node 1 near my settlement
   - Moves toward brick and sheep resources
   - Not the most efficient for resource diversity

6. Road at (7, 24):
   - Connects to my settlement at node 24
   - Leads toward brick resources
   - Not optimal as I already produce brick

7. Road at (25, 26):
   - Extends from current road at node 25
   - Reaches the Ore port (25, 26)
   - Directly aligns with my current plan

## Decision Analysis

Option 7 (Road at edge 25, 26) is clearly the optimal choice for several reasons:
1. It completes my access to the Ore port which is crucial for my strategy
2. Ore will be important for city upgrades and development cards
3. This road directly follows my established plan
4. Having access to the 2:1 Ore port gives me a significant advantage even if my ore production is limited

While option 2 (expanding toward ore/wheat) might seem appealing, the immediate benefit of securing the Ore port is more valuable in the current state.

<plan>
1. Build road at edge (25, 26) to secure the Ore port
2. Next, focus on expansion toward an intersection with Ore and/or Wheat production
3. Use the Ore port to efficiently gather resources for city upgrades
4. Continue looking for opportunities to expand to areas with Wheat (currently lacking)
5. Build at least one more settlement before upgrading to cities
</plan>

\boxed{7}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state:

## Resource Assessment
- I have 1 🧱BRICK and 5 🐑SHEEP
- I'm lacking wheat and ore, which are crucial for city upgrades
- I have access to the ORE port (2:1) at nodes 25-26, which I've connected to with roads

## Position Analysis
- I have 2 settlements (2 VP)
- I've built roads to secure the Ore port (nodes 25-26)
- My settlements produce wood, sheep, and brick, but I lack wheat production
- The robber is on the desert hex, not affecting anyone

## Available Actions
0. End turn
1-4. Maritime trades giving 4 sheep for other resources

## Action Evaluation

Since I have 5 sheep, I can make a maritime trade. The question is whether trading now is optimal or if I should save resources for a future build.

**Option 0: End turn**
- Pros: I keep my resources for future trades/builds
- Cons: I risk losing resources to a 7 roll since I have 6 total cards

**Options 1-4: Trade sheep for another resource**
- I need brick for roads (option 3), but I already have one
- I need wheat for settlements/cities/dev cards (option 2)
- I need ore for cities/dev cards (option 4)
- Wood is needed for settlements/roads (option 1)

Since I connected to the ore port, I should save my sheep until I have enough to trade via the port (2:1) rather than using the default 4:1 rate. Trading now would be inefficient.

<plan>
1. End turn and continue collecting resources
2. Once I have at least 2 sheep, use the ore port to trade for ore efficiently (2:1)
3. Look to expand to a location with wheat production
4. Continue building toward a city strategy once I secure wheat access
5. Take advantage of my ore port connection for efficient city building
</plan>

The most efficient decision is to end my turn and wait for more favorable trading conditions or direct resources from production.

❓ Select action by number (0-4):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state and determine the best action.

### Current Game State Assessment:
- BLUE (me): 2 VP, with 2 settlements
- Resources: 2 Brick, 4 Sheep
- RED: 2 VP, with 2 settlements and slightly longer road network
- The robber is on a wood hex (0,0,0) which produces on an 8 (high probability)

### My Production:
- Settlement at node 0: Wood(8), Sheep(6), Brick(10) - good production
- Settlement at node 24: Brick(8), Sheep(9) - decent production
- I have access to an Ore port at nodes 25-26, allowing 2:1 trades for ore

### Available Options:
- [0] End turn
- [1-4] Maritime trade options to trade 4 sheep for various resources

### Strategic Analysis:
I have 4 sheep, which is enough for a standard 4:1 maritime trade. However, I don't have access to wheat or ore currently, which I need for development cards or cities. My current plan involves using my ore port for efficient trading, but I need to secure wheat access for my city strategy.

Since I have 2 brick already, I could potentially save resources to build a road and settlement toward a wheat hex. The closest wheat hexes appear to be at (0,-1,1) with a 4 and (-1,0,1) with a 6, with the latter being a better probability.

Looking at my options:
1. End turn and wait to collect more resources
2. Trade 4 sheep for 1 of another resource

Trading 4 sheep for 1 resource isn't efficient at this point. I should wait to collect more resources, potentially building toward wheat access next turn if I get more brick.

<plan>
1. End turn to collect more resources
2. Focus on expanding toward wheat access (especially the wheat 6 hex)
3. Use my ore port connection (2:1) once I have sheep to get ore efficiently
4. Continue building toward a city strategy once I secure wheat access
5. Consider blocking RED's expansion if they appear to be moving toward valuable nodes
</plan>

With my current resources, I can't build anything useful, and trading 4:1 is inefficient. The best choice is to end my turn and collect more resources on the next roll.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

RESPONSE:
# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state to make the optimal decision:

## My Resources
- 3 BRICK
- 4 SHEEP
- No WOOD, WHEAT, or ORE

## My VP and Position
- 2 VP (2 settlements)
- I have an ORE port at nodes 25-26, which I'm already connected to
- I have settlements at nodes 0 and 24, giving me production of:
  * WOOD from hex with 8 (high probability)
  * SHEEP from hex with 6 (high probability) and 9 (medium probability)
  * BRICK from hex with 8 (high probability) and 10 (medium probability)
  * No WHEAT or ORE production yet

## Opponent's Position
- RED has 2 VP (2 settlements)
- RED has 3 hidden resources
- RED has settlements at nodes 8 and 16
- RED is producing BRICK, WOOD, SHEEP, and WHEAT
- Their road network is expanding toward the center

## Available Actions
- End turn [0]
- Maritime trades using 4:1 ratio for SHEEP [1-4]

## Strategic Considerations

Looking at my resources, I have 3 BRICK and 4 SHEEP. I'm missing WOOD, WHEAT, and ORE, which are critical for expanding further or upgrading to cities.

While I could do a 4:1 maritime trade to get one of these resources, this would be inefficient. Trading 4 SHEEP for just 1 of any resource isn't a good use of my resources, especially since:

1. I could wait and potentially roll more resources next turn
2. I'm connected to an ORE port (2:1), but I'd need ORE to use it, not SHEEP
3. I don't have enough resources after any trade to build anything meaningful

My current plan involves expanding toward wheat access, particularly the wheat 6 hex, which is a high-probability hex. I should continue with this plan, but I need more resources before I can make meaningful progress.

<plan>
1. End turn to collect more resources
2. Focus on expanding toward wheat access (especially the wheat 6 hex)
3. Use my ore port connection (2:1) once I have ore to trade efficiently
4. Continue building toward a city strategy once I secure wheat access
5. Monitor RED's expansion and possibly block valuable paths
</plan>

Based on this analysis, the most strategic action is to end my turn and wait for more favorable resource rolls.

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and available options to make the optimal decision.

## Current Situation
- I have 5 brick and 4 sheep resources
- I have 2 settlements (2 VP) with no cities yet
- RED also has 2 VP with 2 settlements
- The robber is on the wood 8 hex, blocking a key production hex for me
- I have access to an ore port (2:1) through my road network
- My settlements produce brick, sheep, and wood (but wood is currently blocked)
- I'm lacking direct access to ore and wheat, which are crucial for city upgrades

## Available Actions
I can either end my turn or make various maritime trades. With my 5 brick and 4 sheep, I could trade for other resources.

## Strategic Considerations

1. **Resource Assessment**
   - I have decent amounts of brick and sheep
   - I'm completely missing ore and wheat, which I need for cities
   - My wood production is currently blocked by the robber

2. **Building Opportunities**
   - I can't build anything immediately with just brick and sheep
   - I need wheat and ore for development cards or cities
   - I need wood + brick for roads or settlements

3. **Trading Options Analysis**
   - Trading 4 sheep or brick for 1 of another resource is inefficient (4:1 ratio)
   - I don't have enough of any resource to trade using the specialized ports

4. **Future Production**
   - Once the robber moves, I'll gain wood from my settlement at node 0
   - I should position myself to make better use of resources next turn

## My Decision Process

Given my current resources, I can't build settlements, cities, or development cards. My maritime trade options are all at 4:1 ratio, which is inefficient. Since I'm not in imminent danger and have a good amount of resources already, making a poor trade doesn't seem worthwhile.

I should end my turn to:
1. Hopefully get the robber moved away from my wood production
2. Collect additional resources on the next round
3. Potentially make a more efficient build or trade next turn

<plan>
1. End turn to collect more resources on next rolls
2. Continue focusing on expanding toward wheat access (especially on the board's right side)
3. Use my ore port (2:1) strategically once I collect ore
4. Build a road network toward a wheat-producing hex for my next settlement
5. Monitor RED's expansion and potentially block valuable paths if necessary
</plan>

The optimal action is to end my turn:

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 18 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. End turn to collect more resources on next rolls
2. Continue focusing on expanding toward wheat access (especially on the board's right side)
3. Use my ore port (2:1) strategically once I collect ore
4. Build a road network toward a wheat-producing hex for my next settlement
5. Monitor RED's expansion and potentially block valuable paths if necessary

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current state of the game and my available options to determine the optimal move.

## Current Situation
- I have 2 VP (from 2 settlements)
- I have 6 brick and 4 sheep resources
- The robber is on a wood hex (0,0,0)
- I have access to an ore port (2:1) at nodes 25-26, which I'm connected to
- I lack wood, wheat, and ore resources currently
- RED has 5 hidden resources and is building a road network

## Resource Assessment
I have:
- Brick: 6 (abundant)
- Sheep: 4 (good amount)
- Wood: 0 (none)
- Wheat: 0 (none)
- Ore: 0 (none)

The available actions are limited to maritime trades or ending my turn.

## Trade Analysis
With my current resources, I could:
1. Trade for ore, wood, or wheat using 4:1 basic trades
2. However, I need at least wood + brick to build a road (or wood + brick + sheep + wheat for a settlement)
3. Trading 4 brick for 1 wood would leave me with 2 brick + 1 wood (not enough for multiple builds)
4. Trading 4 sheep for 1 wood would leave me with 6 brick + 0 sheep + 1 wood (enough for just 1 road)

## Strategic Considerations
1. I need more diversified resources - especially wheat and wood
2. With current resources, I can't build anything significant even after trades
3. Saving resources puts me at risk of losing half if a 7 is rolled (I have 10 cards total)
4. RED is expanding their road network and might block valuable paths

## Decision Process
Since I have 10 cards and the robber roll would make me lose 5 cards:
- Making a trade to get below 7 cards would be prudent
- Trading for wood would allow me to build a road on my next turn (if I get another wood)
- Obtaining wood seems most valuable for immediate progress

<plan>
1. Trade for 1 wood using my excess brick (4:1 trade)
2. End turn to collect more resources on next rolls
3. On next turn, try to build roads toward wheat-producing areas
4. Continue focusing on securing wheat access and utilize my ore port once I collect ore
5. Monitor RED's expansion and potentially block valuable paths if necessary
</plan>

Given the risk of having 10 cards and needing wood for future builds, I'll make a 4:1 trade to get wood using my excess brick.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and my options carefully:

## Current Resources
- I have: 1 🌲WOOD, 2 🧱BRICK, 4 🐑SHEEP
- I need: ⛏️ORE and 🌾WHEAT (currently have none)

## Board Position
- I have settlements at node 0 (producing Wood, Sheep, Brick) and node 24 (producing Brick, Sheep)
- I have access to an ORE port at nodes {25, 26}
- I already have a road at (26, 25) connecting to this port
- The robber is on a Wood hex (0,0,0), blocking one of my key resources
- RED player has 3 road segments in a row and might be aiming for longest road

## Available Actions Analysis:

1. **Road Building Options**:
   - Option [1] (24, 53): Extends toward the Wheat port and potential good settlement locations
   - Option [4] (26, 27): Moves toward a Brick-rich area but doesn't open immediate settlement spots
   - Options [2], [3], [5], [6]: Expand from my node 0 settlement
   - Option [7] (7, 24): Connects between my node 24 settlement and tile intersections

2. **Maritime Trade Options**:
   - Options [8-11]: Trade 4 sheep for another resource
   - I could trade for wood to build a road, but I already have 1 wood

3. **End Turn**:
   - Option [0]: Collect more resources on next dice roll

## Strategic Considerations:
- I need Wheat and Ore for development cards and city upgrades
- I should position myself to block RED's path to longest road
- My ore port will be valuable once I start producing ore
- I need to expand toward wheat-producing areas

<plan>
1. Build a road toward the wheat port and wheat-producing regions
2. Focus on securing a third settlement location with wheat production
3. Utilize my ore port once I start collecting ore
4. Watch RED's expansion and potentially block their road path
5. Start working toward city upgrades once I have wheat and ore access
</plan>

Looking at my road options, I need to be strategic with my one wood resource. Option [1] to build a road at edge (24, 53) seems most promising as it extends toward the wheat port and potential wheat-producing areas. This aligns with my need to secure wheat access, which is currently missing from my resource collection.

After careful consideration, I choose to build this road:

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 18 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build a road toward the wheat port and wheat-producing regions
2. Focus on securing a third settlement location with wheat production
3. Utilize my ore port once I start collecting ore
4. Watch RED's expansion and potentially block their road path
5. Start working toward city upgrades once I have wheat and ore access

# Game Analysis

I need to decide on the best move to maximize my chances of winning based on my resources and the current game state.

## Current Resources
- 1 🧱BRICK
- 4 🐑SHEEP

## Current Position Assessment
- I have 2 victory points from 2 settlements
- My settlements are at nodes 0 and 24
- I have access to an ore port at nodes 25-26 (connected to my settlement at 24)
- I have a wheat port accessible near node 53 (already have a road there)
- The robber is on the wood hex (0,0,0), blocking one of my major production hexes
- My strongest production is from BRICK (8) and SHEEP (6, 9)
- I lack WHEAT and ORE production, which are critical for city upgrades

## Available Actions
0. End my turn
1-4. Maritime trade options (4:1 rate) to convert SHEEP into other resources

## Strategic Analysis

Looking at my current plan:
1. Build toward wheat port and wheat regions
2. Get a third settlement with wheat production
3. Utilize ore port once I start collecting ore

I can't build anything this turn as I don't have enough resources. I need both wood and brick for roads, and would need wood/brick/wheat/sheep for a settlement.

Since I have 4 sheep, I could trade them for another resource. However, is that optimal?

Trading options:
- Trade for WOOD: Would give me 1 brick, 1 wood - still need 1 more brick or wood for a road
- Trade for WHEAT: Would give me wheat but I still couldn't build anything
- Trade for BRICK: Would give me 2 brick total, still need wood for a road
- Trade for ORE: Would give me ore but I have no immediate use for it

Since I can't build anything regardless of which trade I make, and I'm using a suboptimal 4:1 trade rate, it's better to hold my sheep for now and wait for a better opportunity. These sheep may become useful for trading with other players or for building a settlement later.

<plan>
1. Save resources this turn, waiting for better trading opportunities or direct resource production
2. Continue aiming to build toward wheat-producing regions
3. Watch RED's expansion carefully - they appear to be expanding toward the wheat regions too
4. Next steps: build a road toward wheat hexes when I get wood, then place settlement near wheat
5. Long-term: leverage my ore port once I establish wheat production for city upgrades
</plan>

Therefore, my best action is to end my turn.

- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 20 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Save resources this turn, waiting for better trading opportunities or direct resource production
2. Continue aiming to build toward wheat-producing regions
3. Watch RED's expansion carefully - they appear to be expanding toward the wheat regions too
4. Next steps: build a road toward wheat hexes when I get wood, then place settlement near wheat
5. Long-term: leverage my ore port once I establish wheat production for city upgrades

# Game State Analysis

Let me carefully analyze my current position and available options:

## Current Resources
- 2 🧱 BRICK
- 4 🐑 SHEEP

## Victory Points
- I have 2 VP from my 2 settlements
- RED also has 2 VP

## Board Position
- I have settlements at nodes 0 and 24
- Settlement at node 0 produces wood(8), sheep(6), brick(10)
- Settlement at node 24 produces brick(8), sheep(9)
- I have an ORE port (2:1) connected to node 25/26
- I am connected to the WHEAT port at nodes 52/53
- The robber is on the wood(8) hex, blocking my good wood production

## Available Actions
I can only:
- End my turn [0]
- Maritime trade 4 sheep for another resource [1-4]

## Strategic Analysis

I currently lack wood, wheat, and ore - all critical resources. My plan indicates I need to build toward wheat regions and eventually use my ore port for city upgrades.

Looking at my maritime trade options:
- Trading 4 sheep for 1 wood [1] would help me build roads
- Trading 4 sheep for 1 wheat [2] would start building toward city capability
- Trading 4 sheep for 1 brick [3] seems unnecessary as I already have 2 brick
- Trading 4 sheep for 1 ore [4] would start building toward city capability

However, the 4:1 maritime trade is very inefficient. I'd be better off waiting until:
1. I can roll for resources naturally
2. I can make better trades (possibly using my ports later)
3. Other players might offer better trade rates

With just 2 brick and potentially 1 more resource from trading, I still can't build a road (needs 1 wood + 1 brick) or settlement (needs wood, brick, sheep, wheat).

<plan>
1. End my turn and wait for better resource production
2. Focus on getting wood to build roads toward wheat-producing regions
3. Continue monitoring RED's expansion toward wheat regions
4. Once I get wood and brick, build roads toward node 53 to leverage my wheat port
5. Long-term: secure wheat and ore production for city upgrades, utilizing my ore port
</plan>

The most efficient action is to end my turn rather than make an inefficient trade.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile

# Analyzing Robber Placement Options

I need to analyze where to move the robber to maximize my strategic position while hindering my opponent's progress.

## Step 1: Assess the Current Game State
- I'm playing BLUE with 2 VPs (2 settlements)
- RED has 2 VPs (2 settlements)
- RED has 7 cards, which means they're vulnerable to the robber's 7+ card rule
- I have 2 brick and 3 sheep - not enough for any immediate build
- Current robber is on brick hex (1,0,-1) with a "10" value

## Step 2: Analyze RED's Production
RED's settlements produce:
- Settlement at node 8: ore 3 (low value), brick 8 (high value), wood 9 (good value)
- Settlement at node 16: wheat 3 (low value), sheep 6 (good value), wheat 5 (medium value)

RED seems to focus on wheat production (2 wheat hexes) and has good brick production.

## Step 3: Evaluate High-Value Targets
Best targets to block RED's production:
1. Brick 8 at (2,-2,0) - high probability hex
2. Sheep 6 at (0,1,-1) - good probability hex
3. Wheat 5 at (-1,2,-1) - medium probability
4. Wood 9 at (1,-2,1) - good probability

## Step 4: Consider My Needs
I need:
- Wood (have none) for expansion
- Wheat (have none) for development cards/cities
- Ore (have none) for development cards/cities

## Step 5: Make Robber Decision
Since RED has 7 cards, I should target their highest-producing hex that doesn't affect me. Looking at the options:

Option [6] - Move robber to (2,-2,0) and steal from RED:
- This is the brick 8 hex (high probability)
- This blocks RED's good brick production at node 8
- Doesn't affect my production
- I might steal a valuable card

Option [7] - Move robber to (1,-2,1) and steal from RED:
- This is the wood 9 hex (good probability)
- Blocks RED's wood production at node 8
- Doesn't affect my production
- I might steal a valuable card

Option [5] - Move robber to (0,1,-1) and steal from RED:
- This is the sheep 6 hex (medium probability)
- Blocks RED's sheep production at node 16
- Would block my own sheep production at node 0 (not a good choice)

Option [13] - Move robber to (-1,2,-1) and steal from RED:
- This is the wheat 5 hex (medium probability)
- Blocks RED's wheat production at node 16
- Doesn't affect my production
- I might steal a valuable card

<plan>
1. Block RED's high-value resources to slow their progress
2. Try to acquire wood and brick to build roads toward wheat regions
3. Target wheat hex (-1,2,-1) or brick hex (2,-2,0) with robber to block RED's production
4. Once I get wood and brick, build roads toward node 53 to leverage my wheat port
5. Long-term: secure wheat and ore production for city upgrades
</plan>

Considering all factors, I'll place the robber on the brick 8 hex (2,-2,0) to block RED's high-probability production while not affecting my own resources. This might also let me steal a valuable resource from RED.

- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 24 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Block RED's high-value resources to slow their progress
2. Try to acquire wood and brick to build roads toward wheat regions
3. Target wheat hex (-1,2,-1) or brick hex (2,-2,0) with robber to block RED's production
4. Once I get wood and brick, build roads toward node 53 to leverage my wheat port
5. Long-term: secure wheat and ore production for city upgrades

# Game Analysis

I need to assess my current position and available actions carefully.

## Current Game State
- I have 2 VP (2 settlements)
- Resources: 2 brick, 4 sheep
- Robber is on brick hex (2,-2,0), blocking one of my key production hexes
- I have a wheat port at nodes 52, 53, and I already have a road at node 53
- Red has 2 VP and 6 hidden cards - they might be planning a significant move

## Available Actions
0. End turn
1-4. Various maritime trades - trading 4 sheep for 1 of another resource

## Strategic Assessment

First, I need to evaluate my current plan:
- My plan mentions blocking Red's resources, but the robber is already on a hex that produces for both me and Red (brick 8)
- I wanted to build roads toward node 53 for the wheat port, but I already have a road there
- I have 2 brick but no wood to build roads
- I have 4 sheep, which allows me to make a maritime trade (4:1)

Looking at my resource production:
- I produce brick (8 and 10), sheep (6 and 9), and wood (8)
- I lack wheat and ore production, which are critical for city upgrades

<plan>
1. Trade 4 sheep for 1 wood using maritime trade
2. On my next turn, use my 2 brick + 1 wood to build a road toward promising settlement locations
3. Target the wheat hex (-1,0,1) or (-1,2,-1) for future expansion to utilize my wheat port
4. Continue focusing on expansion before upgrading to cities
5. Long-term: secure better wheat and ore production for city upgrades
</plan>

Given my current resources and position, I need wood most urgently to pair with my 2 brick for road building. Since I have 4 sheep, I can make a maritime trade.

The optimal action is to trade my 4 sheep for 1 wood, which will enable me to build a road on my next turn (combined with my existing 2 brick).

## Final Decision

\boxed{1}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

RESPONSE:
# Game Analysis for Turn 24

Let me analyze my current position and options:

## Current Status Assessment
- I have 2 VP from my 2 settlements
- I have 1 wood and 2 brick resources
- I have settlements at node 0 (producing wood, sheep, brick) and node 24 (producing brick and sheep)
- I have roads extending from both settlements
- I'm connected to the wheat port at nodes 52, 53

## Resource Analysis
- With 1 wood and 2 brick, I have exactly enough resources to build 1 road
- I lack wheat, ore, and sheep currently

## Available Road Options
The 7 road building options expand in different directions:
1. Road at edge (52, 53): Extends toward the wheat port I already control
2. Road at edge (1, 2): Expands west from my settlement at node 0
3. Road at edge (0, 20): Expands southeast from my settlement at node 0
4. Road at edge (26, 27): Expands east from my brick hex road
5. Road at edge (0, 5): Expands northeast from my settlement at node 0
6. Road at edge (1, 6): Expands east from my settlement at node 0
7. Road at edge (7, 24): Would connect to my settlement at node 24 from the west

## Strategic Considerations
- I need to build roads that lead to valuable settlement locations
- I need to improve my resource diversity, especially getting wheat and ore production
- I should consider which direction offers the best expansion potential

## Evaluating Each Option
1. Edge (52, 53): This builds toward the wheat port I already have access to - redundant
2. Edge (1, 2): This builds west toward node 2, which connects to wheat (4) and ore (3) hexes - promising
3. Edge (0, 20): This builds southeast toward node 20, connecting to brick (10) - already have brick
4. Edge (26, 27): This builds east toward node 27, connecting to brick (8) and wood (9) - already have these
5. Edge (0, 5): This builds northeast toward node 5, connecting to wheat (3) and sheep (6) - decent option
6. Edge (1, 6): This builds east toward node 6, connecting to ore (3) and sheep (9) - decent option
7. Edge (7, 24): This connects to my own settlement - inefficient use of resources

## Best Options Analysis
Looking at resource needs, I need wheat and ore most:
- Option 2 (edge 1, 2) leads toward a node with both wheat and ore hexes
- Option 5 (edge 0, 5) leads toward a node with wheat production
- Option 6 (edge 1, 6) leads toward a node with ore production

<plan>
1. Build a road at edge (1, 2) to expand toward the wheat (4) and ore (3) intersection
2. Continue focusing on expansion to secure wheat and ore production
3. Target a settlement at node 2 to acquire both wheat and ore production
4. Use the wheat port at node 52-53 once I secure wheat production
5. After establishing better resource diversity, consider city upgrades
</plan>

Examining option 2 more closely, node 2 connects to wheat (4) and ore (3) hexes, which are exactly the resources I'm lacking. Building toward this node aligns with my need for resource diversity and positions me for future city upgrades.

Based on this analysis, the optimal choice is to build a road at edge (1, 2):

- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 26 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build a road at edge (1, 2) to expand toward the wheat (4) and ore (3) intersection
2. Continue focusing on expansion to secure wheat and ore production
3. Target a settlement at node 2 to acquire both wheat and ore production
4. Use the wheat port at node 52-53 once I secure wheat production
5. After establishing better resource diversity, consider city upgrades

# Game State Analysis

First, let me analyze my current position and goals:

- I have 2 VP from my settlements (nodes 0 and 24)
- I have 2 wood and 1 brick in my hand - enough for one road
- I lack wheat and ore production entirely
- Red has 2 VP and 6 hidden resources
- The robber is currently on a brick hex (2, -2, 0), which has an 8 roll value

## Resource Analysis
- My production: Strong on wood (8 roll), decent sheep (6 and 9 rolls), and some brick (10 roll)
- Missing: Wheat and ore completely - this is a serious weakness for city upgrades
- My current plan correctly identifies expanding toward wheat and ore as a priority

## Available Road Options
Looking at where each road would lead:

1. Edge (52, 53): Connects to the wheat port, but not directly to a wheat hex
2. Edge (0, 20): Extends toward the center/west side of the board
3. Edge (26, 27): Extends northward from my settlement at 24
4. Edge (2, 3): Moves toward the wheat hex (0, -1, 1) with a roll of 4
5. Edge (2, 9): Moves toward the ore hex (1, -1, 0) with a roll of 3
6. Edge (0, 5): Extends southeast from my settlement at 0
7. Edge (1, 6): Connects toward ore hex (1, -1, 0)
8. Edge (7, 24): Connects back to my settlement at 24

## Strategic Priority
My biggest weakness is the complete lack of wheat and ore production, which I need for city upgrades. Based on my current plan, I want to expand toward wheat (4) and ore (3) resources.

Looking at the board coordinates and connections:
- Road 4 (edge 2, 3) moves me directly toward the wheat hex with a 4 roll value
- Road 5 (edge 2, 9) would help me move toward the ore hex with a 3 roll value

Both wheat and ore are critical, but the wheat hex has a slightly better number (4 vs 3). Additionally, looking at node connectivity, building toward wheat puts me in a position to potentially reach both resources efficiently.

<plan>
1. Build a road at edge (2, 3) to expand toward wheat (4) production
2. In future turns, continue building roads toward a settlement spot that gives me wheat access
3. Then expand toward ore (3) production to complete my resource diversity
4. Once I have access to all resources, focus on city upgrades and development cards
5. Use the wheat port once I secure wheat production to make my economy more efficient
</plan>

After careful analysis, my optimal move is to build the road that advances me toward wheat production first, which is:

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze the current game state and my options carefully:

## Current Status
- I have 2 settlements (2 VP), need 8 more VP to win
- Current resources: 2 wood, 1 brick, 1 sheep
- My settlements produce wood, brick, and sheep, but I have NO wheat or ore production
- The robber is on a brick hex (2,-2,0) with value 8 (high value)

## Resource Analysis
- My biggest weakness is lack of wheat and ore, crucial for cities and development cards
- Currently have exact resources to build one road (1 wood + 1 brick)
- Need to prioritize expansion toward wheat/ore production

## Road Building Options
Looking at the available road options (1-9), I need to determine which road best advances my position toward resource diversification:

1. Edge (52,53): Near the wheat port but doesn't lead toward wheat/ore production
2. Edge (0,20): Expands toward the center but not directly toward wheat/ore 
3. Edge (3,4): Moves toward the wheat hex ((-1,0,1) with value 6)
4. Edge (26,27): Near the robber, doesn't improve resource diversity
5. Edge (2,9): Moves toward wheat hex (0,-1,1) with value 4
6. Edge (0,5): Doesn't lead directly to wheat/ore
7. Edge (3,12): Moves toward wheat hex ((-1,0,1) with value 6) similar to option 3
8. Edge (1,6): Doesn't improve resource diversity significantly
9. Edge (7,24): Doesn't lead to new resource types

## Strategic Priority
My highest priority is to secure wheat production, as it's required for both settlements and cities. Looking at the map, options 3, 5, and 7 all move me toward wheat hexes.

Option 3 (Edge 3,4) is particularly strong as it:
1. Moves me toward a wheat hex with value 6 (high probability)
2. Is part of a logical expansion path
3. Doesn't directly compete with RED's expansion path
4. Opens future settlement locations with access to wheat

<plan>
1. Build a road at edge (3,4) to expand toward wheat (6) production
2. Continue road building toward a settlement spot with wheat access
3. Then target expansion toward ore production to complete resource diversity
4. Once I have access to all resources, focus on city upgrades and development cards
5. Position for longest road as a potential victory point source
</plan>

Building this road is the best use of my current resources, advancing me toward resource diversification while maintaining flexibility for future expansion.

You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 32 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build a road at edge (3,4) to expand toward wheat (6) production
2. Continue road building toward a settlement spot with wheat access
3. Then target expansion toward ore production to complete resource diversity
4. Once I have access to all resources, focus on city upgrades and development cards
5. Position for longest road as a potential victory point source
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Robber Placement Analysis

Let me analyze where to place the robber for maximum strategic benefit.

## Step 1: Evaluate Game State
- I'm BLUE with 2 VP from settlements
- RED also has 2 VP from settlements
- Currently we have similar position, but I need to understand what resources to target

## Step 2: Analyze Opponent's Production
RED player has settlements at:
- Node 8: producing brick(8), ore(3), wood(9)
- Node 16: producing wheat(3), sheep(6), wheat(5)

RED has good access to wheat (two hexes), and also has brick, ore, wood, and sheep.

## Step 3: Consider My Resource Needs
I have 2 wood, 1 sheep, and need brick, wheat and ore for expansion. Based on my plan, I particularly need:
- Wheat: For settlements and cities
- Ore: For city upgrades and development cards

## Step 4: Evaluate Robber Placement Options
The best robber placements would be:
1. [4] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED - This is wheat (3) and RED has a settlement here
2. [13] Move robber to (-1, 2, -1) and steal from RED - This is wheat (5) and RED has a settlement here
3. [5] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED - This is sheep (6) and RED has a settlement here
4. [7] Move robber to (1, -2, 1) and steal from RED - This is wood (9) and RED has a settlement here

## Step 5: Make Decision
Looking at RED's settlements and the likelihood of getting valuable resources:
- Wheat appears to be RED's strongest resource (two hexes: 3 and 5)
- The wheat (5) hex at (-1, 2, -1) has a higher probability than wheat (3)
- Blocking this wheat production would slow RED's development
- When I steal, I have a good chance of getting wheat which I need

<plan>
1. Block RED's wheat production to slow their progress
2. Still aim to build a road at edge (3,4) to expand toward wheat production
3. Continue working toward securing my own wheat access
4. Position for expansion toward ore production
5. Focus on city upgrades once resource diversity is achieved
</plan>

Option [13] offers the best combination of disrupting RED's progress while potentially gaining a resource I need (wheat).

# Game State Analysis

I need to carefully assess the current state and determine the optimal move.

## Current Resources
I have 3 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat.

## Victory Points Assessment
- I have 2 VP from my 2 settlements
- Red also has 2 VP from 2 settlements
- Game is early, we're tied

## Production Analysis
My settlements produce:
- At node 0: Wood (8), Sheep (6), Brick (10)
- At node 24: Brick (8), Sheep (9)

I have good production of wood, brick, and sheep, but I'm lacking wheat and ore production.

## Settlement Building Opportunities
I have 4 potential settlement locations:
- Node 2: Connects to Wood (8), Wheat (4), Ore (3)
- Node 3: Connects to Wood (8), Wheat (4), Wheat (6)
- Node 4: Connects to Wood (8), Wheat (6), Wheat (3)
- Node 26: Connects to Brick (8), next to Ore port

I currently have the exact resources needed to build a settlement (1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat).

## Strategic Priorities
1. I need to diversify my resources, particularly gaining access to wheat and ore
2. I should expand my presence on the board
3. I need to block Red's potential expansion paths

## Decision Analysis

Building a settlement would give me immediate VP progress and improve resource production. Looking at the options:

- Node 2 gives me access to wood (which I already have), plus wheat and ore (which I need)
- Node 3 would give me strong wheat production from two wheat hexes (4 and 6)
- Node 4 would also give me good wheat production (6 and 3)
- Node 26 is near an ore port but doesn't seem to add new resource types

Of these, Node 3 appears most strategic as it would give me access to two wheat hexes (one with a good number 6), providing the wheat I'm missing. Node 2 would give me both wheat and ore, but the ore hex has a low probability (3).

<plan>
1. Build a settlement at node 3 to secure wheat production
2. Next focus on getting ore access through expansion or trade
3. Work toward cities once I have reliable ore/wheat production
4. Consider expansion toward the wheat port at nodes 52/53
</plan>

Since I have exactly the resources needed for a settlement, and gaining wheat production is critical for my strategy, I'll build a settlement at node 3.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

I need to carefully analyze my position and my available actions to determine the optimal play.

## Current Situation Assessment
- I have 3 victory points from my 3 settlements
- I have 2 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK, 1 🐑SHEEP resources
- Red has 4 VP (2 settlements + longest road)
- I have strong wood production with 8 on two settlements
- I can build one road with my current resources

## Road Building Options Analysis
Let me analyze each road option to see which provides the most strategic value:

1. Road at edge (52, 53) - This would extend toward the wheat port, supporting my plan to secure better wheat trading
2. Road at edge (0, 20) - Extends from my settlement toward the center of the board
3. Road at edge (26, 27) - Extends toward brick resources but doesn't immediately lead to a settlement spot
4. Road at edge (4, 15) - Extends toward wheat but not immediately to a settlement location
5. Road at edge (2, 9) - Connects between my settlements, doesn't open new settlement opportunities
6. Road at edge (4, 5) - Moves toward sheep production
7. Road at edge (0, 5) - Connects toward another direction from my settlement
8. Road at edge (3, 12) - Connects from my settlement toward potential expansion
9. Road at edge (1, 6) - Moves toward center of board
10. Road at edge (7, 24) - Connects between existing settlements, doesn't open new opportunities

## Strategic Considerations
1. **Longest Road Potential**: I currently have a longest road of 4, while Red has 5. Building strategically could help me overtake Red for the 2 VP bonus.
2. **Settlement Expansion**: I need to prioritize roads that lead to viable settlement locations.
3. **Resource Access**: My settlements have good wood and wheat but limited access to ore, which I'll need for cities.
4. **Port Access**: The wheat port at nodes 52/53 would be valuable based on my wheat production.

## Decision Making

Looking at my existing plan, I want to work toward the wheat port at nodes 52/53, which would give me more flexibility with my wheat resources. Building a road at edge (52, 53) directly supports this plan and moves me closer to this valuable port.

The road at (52, 53) also contributes to my road network in a way that could help me eventually contend for longest road. If I can secure this port and later build a settlement here, I'll have improved trading capability plus another victory point.

<plan>
1. Build a road toward the wheat port at edge (52, 53)
2. Continue expanding toward the wheat port to establish a settlement there
3. Next focus on getting ore access through expansion or trade
4. Work toward cities once I have reliable ore/wheat production
</plan>

Based on this strategic analysis, I will build a road at edge (52, 53).

# Game Analysis for Turn 38

Let me carefully analyze the current game state and my available options to determine the optimal move.

## Current Situation
- I (BLUE) have 3 VP from 3 settlements
- RED has 4 VP (2 settlements + longest road bonus)
- Resources: 3 Wood + 1 Brick + 1 Sheep
- I can build a road with my current resources (1 Wood + 1 Brick)
- My current plan involves building toward the wheat port at edge (52, 53)

## Board Position Analysis
- I have settlements at nodes 0, 24, and 3
- My resources are primarily wood-heavy with some brick and sheep
- RED has longest road with 5 segments (I have 4 segments as my longest)

## Road Options Analysis

Let me evaluate each road option based on my strategic goals:

**Option [2] Build road at edge (23, 52):**
This directly follows my current plan to reach the wheat port. Building here extends toward node 52, which is part of the wheat port (nodes 52, 53). This aligns perfectly with my strategy.

**Option [7] Build road at edge (51, 52):**
This is also directed toward the wheat port, but from a different direction. Looking at the board layout, I need to check if this is a more efficient path.

**Option [11] Build road at edge (7, 24):**
This connects from my settlement at node 24 toward node 7. This could potentially help with securing more brick (8) or wood (9) resources.

**Option [3] Build road at edge (26, 27):**
This would extend toward the ore port area, which could be valuable since I need ore for city upgrades later.

**Options [1], [4], [5], [6], [8], [9], [10]:**
These don't clearly advance me toward critical resources or valuable building spots based on my current plan.

## Strategic Considerations

1. **Path to Victory**: I need to increase my VP count, so building toward settlement spots is crucial.
2. **Resource Access**: I currently lack reliable ore and wheat production for city upgrades.
3. **Threatening RED's Longest Road**: If I can build 2 more roads to reach 6 segments, I could take the longest road bonus from RED.

Looking at the coordinates and my current road network, option [2] (edge 23, 52) appears to be the most direct path toward establishing a settlement at the wheat port, which aligns with my current plan.

<plan>
1. Build road at edge (23, 52) moving toward the wheat port
2. Continue expanding to eventually build a settlement at the wheat port (node 52 or 53)
3. Focus next on securing ore access for city upgrades
4. Consider challenging RED for longest road bonus if opportunity arises
</plan>

Option [2] is optimal as it:
- Continues my path toward the wheat port as per my plan
- Positions me to secure better wheat production/trading
- Creates a path for future settlement expansion
- Uses my available resources efficiently

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis & Decision

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 3 VP from 3 settlements (no cities yet)
- RED has 4 VP (2 settlements + 2 VP for longest road)
- I have limited resources: 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 sheep
- My current plan involves moving toward the wheat port
- The robber is on forest (8) hex blocking one of my high-value resources

## My Resource Production
- I have good wood production from 8's
- Decent wheat production from 6's
- Brick from 8's and 10's
- Sheep from 6's and 9's
- Notably lacking ore production for city upgrades

## Strategic Options

Looking at my available road building options:
1. Option #3 (edge 22, 23): Extends toward wheat port (aligns with plan)
2. Option #8 (edge 51, 52): Gets me directly adjacent to wheat port
3. Other options point in various directions, but don't support my current plan as directly

Since my plan is to move toward the wheat port, I need to examine which option gets me closer most efficiently.

Looking at the node map, building at edge (51, 52) with option #8 appears to be the most direct route to reach the wheat port at nodes 52/53. This aligns perfectly with my current plan's first step.

This move would allow me to:
1. Move directly toward the wheat port
2. Set up my next build to secure a valuable 2:1 wheat trading capability
3. Maintain my current strategic direction

<plan>
1. Build road at edge (51, 52) moving toward the wheat port
2. Continue expanding to build a settlement at the wheat port (node 52 or 53)
3. Focus on securing ore access for city upgrades
4. Consider challenging RED for longest road bonus if opportunity arises
</plan>

After analyzing all options, I'm choosing to build a road at edge (51, 52) with option #8, as it directly advances my plan to reach the wheat port.

# Game Analysis for Turn 54

I'll analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action.

## Current Situation
- I (BLUE) have 3 victory points from 3 settlements
- RED has 6 victory points (2 settlements + 1 city + longest road bonus)
- I have resources: 1 🧱BRICK, 4 🐑SHEEP, 3 🌾WHEAT
- My current plan involves building a road toward the wheat port and then a settlement near it

## Resource Analysis
- I lack wood and ore currently
- I need brick + wood to build a road, and I only have 1 brick
- I need 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat, 1 sheep to build a settlement
- I need 3 ore + 2 wheat for a city upgrade

## Available Actions
I can only:
1. End my turn
2-4. Various maritime trades using my sheep

## Strategic Considerations

RED is at 6 VP, so they're significantly ahead. I need to accelerate my progress. My current plan of building toward the wheat port (node 52 or 53) is sound, as it would give me access to efficient wheat trading. However, I can't build a road this turn since I'm missing wood.

The maritime trade options would let me convert my excess sheep into other resources. Trading for brick would help with my road building, but I already have 1 brick. Trading for wood would let me build a road this turn, bringing me closer to the wheat port and potential settlement location.

Looking at my production, I have good wood production (8 is a high-probability number), but the robber is on the wheat hex. I'm particularly weak on ore production, which I'll need for city upgrades.

<plan>
1. Trade sheep for wood to build a road toward the wheat port (edge 51-52)
2. Continue expanding to build a settlement at the wheat port (node 52 or 53)
3. Focus on securing ore access for city upgrades
4. Consider challenging RED for longest road bonus if opportunity arises
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I should trade 4 sheep for 1 wood, allowing me to build a road this turn and continue my expansion toward the wheat port.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game State Analysis

Let me thoroughly analyze the current game state to determine the optimal move.

## VP Analysis
- BLUE (me): 3 VP (3 settlements)
- RED: 6 VP (2 settlements, 1 city, longest road bonus)
- RED is 3 points ahead and already at 6/10 VP

## Resource Analysis
- My resources: 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 3 Wheat
- I can build exactly one road with my current wood and brick

## My Current Production
- Good wood production (8 probability)
- Good sheep production (6 and 9 probability)
- Decent brick production (8 and 10 probability)
- Some wheat production (4 and 6 probability)
- Missing ore production completely

## Strategic Assessment
1. I'm far behind RED who already has 6 VP.
2. RED has longest road with 6 segments (I have 5).
3. I need to focus on high-value builds since I'm behind.
4. My wheat port expansion plan is valid, but I need to consider the quickest path to victory.

## Action Options Analysis
Looking at road building options, I need to prioritize roads that:
1. Lead to potential settlement locations
2. Could eventually help me claim longest road
3. Expand toward resources I lack (primarily ore)

Road edge (50, 51) connects toward the wheat port location and aligns with my current plan. Road edge (22, 23) would be in the same direction. Looking at the map, the ore hex (2, 0, -2) is also in that direction.

Road edge (1, 6) would extend toward node 6, which connects to the ore hex (1, -1, 0) probability 3, which isn't great but is my only option for accessing ore.

## Revised Plan
<plan>
1. Build road at edge (50, 51) to continue toward wheat port and possible ore access
2. Next turns: Continue expanding toward a settlement at node 52 (wheat port) 
3. After securing the wheat port, look for opportunities to gain ore access
4. Challenge RED for longest road if possible (need 2 more roads to overtake)
5. Use wheat port to convert excess wheat to resources needed for city upgrades
</plan>

Given my current resources and position, continuing with the original plan makes the most sense. Building the road at edge (50, 51) advances me toward the wheat port and potential ore access.

# Robber Placement Analysis

Let me analyze this carefully since robber placement is a critical strategic decision.

## Game State Assessment
- I'm BLUE with 3 VP (3 settlements)
- RED has 6 VP (2 settlements, 1 city, longest road)
- RED is clearly in the lead, so disrupting their production should be my priority
- I have 1 brick, 1 sheep, 3 wheat currently

## My Current Plan
My plan involves building toward the wheat port and securing more ore access, while potentially challenging RED for longest road.

## Robber Placement Options Analysis

I should prioritize:
1. Hexes that produce valuable resources for RED
2. Hexes with high probability numbers (6 & 8)
3. Hexes where RED has multiple buildings

Looking at RED's buildings:
- City at node 8: produces ore3, brick8, wood9
- Settlement at node 16: produces wheat3, sheep6, wheat5
- Settlement at node 10: produces wheat4, wood9, sheep5

The most valuable targets appear to be:
- Option [6] targeting brick8 hex (2,-2,0) - High value 8, critical for RED's city
- Option [7] targeting wood9 hex (1,-2,1) - Connected to RED's city and settlement
- Option [4] targeting sheep6 hex (0,1,-1) - Connected to RED's settlement
- Option [2] targeting wheat4 hex (0,-1,1) - Connected to both RED and my settlement

Since I'm trying to catch up to RED who is 3 points ahead, I need to be aggressive. Looking at their production, brick is likely a critical resource for them if they're trying to maintain longest road. The brick8 hex is a high-probability tile and directly feeds RED's city.

<plan>
1. Place robber on brick8 hex to block RED's high-value production
2. Continue building road at edge (50, 51) toward wheat port
3. Work toward settlement at node 52 for wheat port access
4. Challenge RED for longest road (need 2 more roads to overtake)
5. Focus on acquiring ore for city upgrades
</plan>

The optimal choice is option [6] - move the robber to the brick8 hex (2,-2,0) and steal from RED. This targets a high-probability resource that RED needs for road building, and it connects to their city which gives double production.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 58 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Place robber on brick8 hex to block RED's high-value production
2. Continue building road at edge (50, 51) toward wheat port

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan - Turn 58

Let me analyze the current game state and available options to determine the optimal move.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I (BLUE) have 3 VP from 3 settlements
- RED has 6 VP (3 from buildings + 2 from longest road + likely 1 hidden VP card)
- RED is 4 points ahead and closer to winning
- I have 1 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK, 1 🐑SHEEP, 3 🌾WHEAT
- RED has longest road with 6 segments (I also have 6 segments according to the status)
- The robber is on brick8, already blocking RED's high-value resource

## Available Options Analysis

### Option: Build Settlement
With my current resources, I can build a settlement. This would immediately give me +1 VP and additional resource production.

Looking at settlement locations:
- Node 23: Connects to 🧱10[⭐] and 🐑9[⭐⭐] - decent but not optimal
- Node 26: On ore port (2:1) and connects to 🧱8[⭐⭐⭐] - very strong for future ore trading
- Node 50: Only connects to ⛏️2[⭐] - poor production
- Node 51: Only connects to ⛏️2[⭐] - poor production
- Node 52: On wheat port (2:1) and connects to ⛏️2[⭐] and 🐑9[⭐⭐] - moderate with port advantage

Node 26 stands out as the strongest option with ore port access and brick production.

### Option: Build Road
I have exactly enough resources for one road, but this doesn't immediately increase my VP or production. However, it could position me for future expansion or to contest longest road.

The road at edge (49, 50) moves toward the wheat port and node 52, aligning with my current plan.

### Analysis of Victory Path

I need to close the 3-point gap with RED:
1. Building a settlement now gives me +1 VP immediately
2. I could later compete for longest road (+2 VP)
3. Future city upgrades would give +1 VP each
4. Development cards could provide hidden VP or knights for largest army

Looking at my resource production and current position, settlement building is most strategic for immediate gain, particularly at node 26 which offers both good production and trading benefits through the ore port.

## Strategic Decision

I will build a settlement at node 26. This gives me:
1. Immediate +1 VP, reducing RED's lead
2. Access to the valuable 2:1 ore port
3. Additional 🧱8[⭐⭐⭐] production
4. Ore trading capability which aligns with my city upgrade strategy

<plan>
1. Build settlement at node 26 for ore port access
2. Work toward city upgrades using the ore port to optimize trading
3. Continue expanding roads to challenge RED for longest road
4. Target settlement at node 52 for wheat port in future turns
5. Focus on acquiring ore/wheat through production and trading for city upgrades
</plan>

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

# Analyzing the Game State

Let me carefully assess the current situation:

## Victory Points
- BLUE (me): 4 VP (4 settlements)
- RED: 7 VP (3 settlements + 1 city + longest road bonus)
- RED is 3 points ahead and closer to winning

## My Resources
- 3 sheep
- 4 wheat
- No other resources

## Building Options
I cannot currently build anything because:
- Settlement (1 brick, 1 wood, 1 wheat, 1 sheep) - Missing brick and wood
- City (3 ore, 2 wheat) - Missing ore
- Development card (1 ore, 1 wheat, 1 sheep) - Missing ore
- Road (1 brick, 1 wood) - Missing brick and wood

## Trade Options
I have access to the 2:1 ore port at node 26, but lacking resources to trade efficiently.
My current options are only 4:1 trades using wheat.

## Strategic Assessment
1. RED is at 7 points and could be close to winning
2. I need to upgrade settlements to cities to catch up in points
3. I lack ore which is critical for city upgrades
4. I have a settlement at the ore port, which gives me a 2:1 trade advantage for ore

## Decision Analysis

For my available actions:
- [0] End turn - Not making progress but preserving resources
- [1-4] Trade options - All are inefficient 4:1 trades

Trading 4 wheat for 1 ore (option 4) would give me a resource I critically need for city upgrades, but it's an inefficient trade. However, getting ore would allow me to use my ore port efficiently in future turns.

I need ore to make progress toward cities or development cards. Since I have an ore port, getting even one ore can help me leverage better trades in future turns.

<plan>
1. Trade for ore now to begin accessing my ore port
2. Focus on upgrading settlements to cities to catch up in points
3. Consider development cards if I can get ore
4. Watch for opportunities to break RED's longest road
5. Continue leveraging my ore port for efficient city upgrades
</plan>

Given the analysis, I need ore to make progress, and waiting another turn without making progress could allow RED to get closer to winning. Trading for ore now will position me better for future turns.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Turn 66 (BLUE Player)

I'll carefully analyze my position and the available actions to determine the optimal move.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 4 VP (4 settlements)
- RED has 7 VP (3 settlements, 1 city, longest road +2)
- I'm 6 points behind RED who is close to winning (needs 3 more points)
- My resources: 1 BRICK, 4 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE
- I have access to an ORE port (2:1)

## Action Options Analysis

**Option 0: End Turn**
- Accomplishes nothing and wastes my current resources
- Not viable when I need to catch up to RED's lead

**Option 1: Buy Development Card (1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE)**
- Pros: Could yield Victory Point, Knight (to potentially get largest army), or useful action cards
- I have exactly the resources needed
- Development cards are my most efficient VP path right now (no resources for settlements/cities)
- Could help catch up to RED who is 3 points ahead

**Options 2-5: Maritime Trading**
- All involve trading 4 SHEEP for 1 resource
- This is inefficient (regular 4:1 trade) when I have an ORE port nearby
- Trading would leave me with insufficient resources to build anything this turn

## Strategic Considerations
- RED is at 7 points and likely close to winning
- I need to accelerate my VP acquisition
- My current resources don't allow for settlement or city building
- Development cards offer a hidden way to gain points and potentially disrupt RED's position
- Buying a development card is the only option that could potentially yield immediate victory points

<plan>
1. Buy development cards when possible to gain victory points or knights
2. Continue working toward cities by collecting ORE and WHEAT
3. Use my ORE port (2:1) for efficient trades in future turns
4. Look for opportunities to break RED's longest road
5. Focus on upgrading settlements to cities once I have resources
</plan>

Given my limited options and the need to catch up to RED, buying a development card is clearly my best strategic choice right now. It's the only move that might yield either an immediate VP card or a knight to help me toward largest army.

❓ Select action by number (0-1):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I need to analyze my situation and decide between playing my Road Building card or rolling the dice.

## Game State Analysis

Current victory points:
- BLUE (me): 4 VP (from 4 settlements)
- RED: 7 VP (3 settlements = 3 VP, 1 city = 2 VP, longest road = 2 VP)

RED is ahead by 3 VP and is close to winning. I have:
- Resources: 1 🧱BRICK, 4 🐑SHEEP
- 1 ROAD_BUILDING development card
- No immediate builds possible with current resources

## Option Analysis

**Option 0: Play Road Building card**
- Advantages:
  - Can place 2 free roads anywhere I have legal placement
  - Could potentially break RED's longest road (they have 6 segments)
  - Roads are essential for expansion and potential longest road bonus
- Disadvantages:
  - I don't have resources to immediately build a settlement after placing roads
  - I might want to save the card for when I have resources to immediately capitalize on the new roads

**Option 1: Roll the dice**
- Advantages:
  - Might gain resources needed for building
  - I have good production potential with 4 settlements
  - Can still play the development card after rolling if desired
- Disadvantages:
  - Could roll a 7 and lose resources if opponents have >7 cards
  - Random outcome

## Strategic Considerations

1. RED is at 7 VP, so they're 3 points ahead. I need to slow them down while accelerating my progress.
2. Breaking RED's longest road would reduce them to 5 VP, bringing us closer.
3. Examining my settlements' production:
   - I have strong production on 8s (both wood and brick)
   - I have good wheat production on 6
   
4. Looking at potential road placements:
   - I should consider where I could place roads to potentially:
     a) Break RED's longest road
     b) Set myself up for new settlements
     c) Work toward longest road myself

However, I don't have enough information right now about the exact road connections to make that decision optimally. I should first roll to gain resources, then consider using Road Building when I can immediately capitalize on it.

<plan>
1. Focus on breaking RED's longest road to reduce their VP count
2. Use my Road Building card strategically to either break their road or extend mine
3. Continue collecting resources to build cities (ORE and WHEAT)
4. Watch for settlement opportunities that give me access to ORE
5. Use my ORE port (2:1) efficiently once I have ORE
</plan>

The optimal play is to roll the dice first, gather more resources, then decide how to best use the Road Building card based on what I collect.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 68 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Focus on breaking RED's longest road to reduce their VP count
2. Use my Road Building card strategically to either break their road or extend mine
3. Continue collecting resources to build cities (ORE and WHEAT)
4. Watch for settlement opportunities that give me access to ORE
5. Use my ORE port (2:1) efficiently once I have ORE

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and determine the best action to take:

## Current Situation
- I have 4 VP (4 settlements)
- Red player has 7 VP (3 settlements, 1 city, longest road bonus)
- I have 2 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK, 4 🐑SHEEP
- I have a ROAD_BUILDING development card
- Red is only 3 VP away from winning

## My Resources and Options
My current resources only allow me to build 1 road normally (1 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK). However, I have a Road Building card that would allow me to build 2 roads for free.

## Strategic Priorities
1. Red is close to winning with 7/10 VP
2. Breaking Red's longest road would remove 2 VP from them, buying me time
3. I need to work toward upgrading settlements to cities (need ORE and WHEAT)
4. I need to maintain expansion possibilities

## Evaluating the Road Building Card
Playing the Road Building card is clearly the best option since:
1. It lets me build 2 roads for free, saving resources
2. I can potentially position myself to break Red's longest road
3. I can expand toward valuable resources or ports

Looking at the available road building options, I need to determine which roads would be most strategic. Without seeing the exact layout of Red's longest road, I need to make an educated guess about which roads might help break their connection.

Since my current plan explicitly mentions breaking Red's longest road, I should use the Road Building card to strategically position myself for that goal while also strengthening my position.

<plan>
1. Use Road Building card to place roads strategically that can disrupt Red's longest road or extend mine toward valuable resources
2. Focus on collecting ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (ORE especially since I have an ORE port)
3. Monitor settlement opportunities that give me access to ORE
4. Consider trading 4 SHEEP for a needed resource if it enables an important build
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I should play my Road Building card:

1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 68 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Use Road Building card to place roads strategically that can disrupt Red's longest road or extend mine toward valuable resources
2. Focus on collecting ORE and WHEAT for city upgrades (ORE especially since I have an ORE port)
3. Monitor settlement opportunities that give me access to ORE
4. Consider trading 4 SHEEP for a needed resource if it enables an important build

❓ Select action by number (0-11):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I need to analyze my position and choose the best road placement from the available options.

First, let's assess my current situation:
- I have 4 VP from 4 settlements and no cities
- I have 2 wood, 1 brick, and 4 sheep in my hand
- Red player has 7 VP (including 2 VP from longest road)
- Red is 3 points ahead of me and closing in on victory

Let me evaluate my road placement options in terms of strategic value:

1) Edge (0, 20): This connects my settlement at node 0 toward node 20, which could potentially help me expand toward the wheat port or challenge Red's road network.

2) Edge (26, 27): This connects from my settlement at node 26 toward node 27, which could help me expand northward.

3) Edge (22, 23): This connects nodes in the eastern part of the board, potentially connecting to my settlement at node 24.

4) Edge (4, 15): This connects from node 4 outward, which doesn't appear to be near my existing settlements.

5) Edge (2, 9): This connects from my settlement at node 3 (via node 2) toward node 9, which seems to be toward Red's territory.

6) Edge (4, 5): This expands from node 4 toward node 5, which doesn't seem immediately valuable.

7) Edge (6, 23): This would connect nodes 6 and 23, potentially linking parts of my road network.

8) Edge (0, 5): This expands from my settlement at node 0 toward node 5, which could help me expand in that direction.

9) Edge (49, 50): This connects nodes in the eastern part of the board, away from my current positions.

10) Edge (3, 12): This expands from my settlement at node 3 toward node 12, which could be useful for expansion.

11) Edge (1, 6): This connects nodes 1 and 6, potentially linking my settlement at node 0 to new areas.

12) Edge (7, 24): This would connect my settlement at node 24 to node 7, which could be valuable for expansion.

Looking at the longest road situation:
- Red currently has longest road (6 segments) and the 2 VP bonus
- I have a longest road of 6 segments as well, but Red must have got there first
- If I can extend my road network to 7+ segments, I could potentially steal the longest road bonus

The most strategic options appear to be those that either:
1) Help me take longest road from Red
2) Block Red's potential expansion
3) Open up new valuable settlement locations for me

Based on the node connections and my current settlements, I need to prioritize building roads that extend my network cohesively while blocking Red's expansion.

<plan>
1. Focus on extending my road network to steal longest road (2 VP) from Red
2. Place roads strategically to block Red's expansion or connect my network
3. Continue gathering resources for city upgrades (especially ore and wheat)
4. Look for opportunities to place additional settlements at valuable locations
</plan>

Given the limited information about the exact road connections, I'll choose the option that seems most likely to either extend my longest road path or block Red's expansion. From the available options, building a road at edge (0, 20) appears most strategic as it extends from my settlement at node 0 and could potentially help me compete for longest road while opening new settlement opportunities.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze my position and available moves to determine the optimal action:

## Current Game State
- I have 4 VP (from 4 settlements)
- Red has 7 VP (3 settlements, 1 city, and Longest Road +2 VP)
- Red is 3 VP ahead and close to winning
- My resources: 2 wood, 1 brick, 4 sheep (can build exactly 1 road)
- Red has Longest Road with 6 segments, and I also have a continuous road of 6 segments

## Key Strategic Considerations
1. Red is close to winning (7/10 VP)
2. Taking Longest Road from Red would be a 4-point swing (Red -2 VP, me +2 VP)
3. I need to build roads strategically to:
   - Create a longer continuous road segment than Red's 6 segments
   - Block Red's potential expansion
   - Set up future settlement placement

## Road Placement Options Analysis
Looking at my available road options, I need to determine which would contribute most to creating a longer continuous road:

- Roads at edges involving nodes 0, 3, 24, 26 are likely extending my existing network
- I need to check which option creates the longest continuous path

The most strategic road would be one that:
1. Extends my longest road path beyond 6 segments
2. Potentially blocks Red's expansion
3. Sets me up for future settlement placements

Looking at the available options, I need to determine which road would create my longest continuous path. Since I currently have a path of length 6 and Red has Longest Road with 6 segments, adding a road to extend my longest path to 7 segments would give me the Longest Road bonus (2 VP).

Based on the board state and my settlements at nodes 0, 3, 24, and 26, I believe building a road at edge (1, 6) (option 11) would likely extend my longest continuous path to 7 segments, giving me Longest Road and a significant VP advantage over Red.

<plan>
1. Build a road to claim Longest Road (2 VP) from Red
2. Next focus on gathering resources for development cards or a city upgrade
3. Continue to block Red's expansion and maintain longest road
4. Look for opportunities to place an additional settlement at a valuable location

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Analysis of Game State

Let me analyze the current game state to determine the optimal move.

## Current Standings
- **BLUE (me)**: 4 VP (4 settlements)
- **RED**: 7 VP (3 settlements + 1 city + Longest Road bonus)

RED is at 7 VP, which means they only need 3 more to win. I'm at 4 VP, so I need 6 more. This is a significant gap that requires an urgent strategic move.

## Resources Available
I have:
- 2 🌲WOOD
- 1 🧱BRICK
- 4 🐑SHEEP

This allows me to build exactly one road (costs 1 wood + 1 brick).

## Strategic Assessment
My current plan mentions building a road to claim Longest Road (2 VP) from RED. This seems critical since:
1. It denies RED 2 VP, pushing them back to 5 VP
2. It gives me 2 VP, advancing me to 6 VP
3. It's achievable with my current resources

Currently RED has a Longest Road of 6, and my longest is also 6. If I build one more strategic road, I can increase my longest road to 7 and steal the bonus.

## Road Building Options
Looking at the road options, I need to identify which one extends my longest continuous road path:
- I need to look for edges that connect to my existing road network without creating branches that don't count for Longest Road.

Option [1]: road at edge (26, 27) - This appears to extend my road network from settlement at node 26, which could potentially increase my longest road.

Option [4]: road at edge (22, 23) - This seems to connect nodes in an area where I have existing roads that may be part of my longest path.

Actually, after considering the connectivity of the board and my road network, the most strategic option appears to be option [4] at edge (22, 23). This will extend my longest road to 7 segments, allowing me to claim the Longest Road bonus from RED.

## Final Decision
Building a road at edge (22, 23) will:
1. Increase my longest road to 7 segments (taking the bonus from RED)
2. Add 2 VP to my total (getting me to 6 VP)
3. Reduce RED to 5 VP (from 7 VP)
4. Use my available wood and brick efficiently

<plan>
1. Build road at edge (22, 23) to claim Longest Road bonus (+2 VP)
2. Next focus on gathering resources for a city upgrade (need ore and wheat)
3. Continue blocking RED's expansion and maintain longest road
4. Look for opportunities to place an additional settlement if possible
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible

- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic

- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:

# Game Analysis

Let me assess my current situation, resources, and available actions:

## Current Status
- I have 4 VP (4 settlements)
- RED has 7 VP (3 settlements + 1 city + longest road bonus)
- I have 1 WOOD and 4 SHEEP (insufficient for most builds)
- RED has the longest road (6 segments) but my longest is also 6
- RED is 3 VP ahead, which is a significant lead

## My Current Plan
My plan was to build a road at (22, 23) to claim the longest road bonus (+2 VP), but I don't have the resources for a road right now (need 1 wood + 1 brick).

## Available Actions
1-4: Maritime trades giving 4 sheep for other resources
0: End turn

I have 4 sheep, which allows me to make one trade at the general 4:1 rate. The most valuable resource would be brick, as I need it to build a road to take longest road from RED. However, I notice I have access to the 2:1 ORE port (nodes 25, 26), but I don't have enough sheep to utilize it right now.

Since my goal is to claim the longest road bonus (+2 VP), I need to build a road, which requires WOOD and BRICK. I already have 1 WOOD, so I need 1 BRICK.

<plan>
1. Make a maritime trade to get 1 brick (4 sheep → 1 brick)
2. On my next turn, build a road at edge (22, 23) to claim Longest Road bonus (+2 VP)
3. Focus on gathering resources for a city upgrade (need ore and wheat)
4. Continue blocking RED's expansion and maintain longest road
5. Look for opportunities to place an additional settlement if possible
</plan>

Looking at my options, the logical choice is to trade 4 sheep for 1 brick using option #3, which will allow me to build a road on my next turn and potentially claim longest road.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis - Settlers of Catan Turn 68

I need to analyze the current state and determine my best move to improve my position toward winning.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I (BLUE) have 4 VP from 4 settlements
- RED has 7 VP (3 settlements + 1 city + longest road bonus)
- RED is 3 VP ahead and closer to winning (10 VP goal)
- I have only 1 wood and 1 brick resource
- RED currently has longest road with 6 segments, and I also have 6 segments

## Strategic Considerations
1. I can build exactly one road with my 1 wood + 1 brick
2. RED is much closer to winning with 7 VP vs my 4 VP
3. I need to focus on high-impact moves that advance my position
4. My current plan mentions building a road at edge (22, 23) to claim longest road, but that's not in the options

## Road Options Analysis
Looking at the 13 road options, I need to determine which:
- Could lead to claiming longest road (2 VP bonus)
- Opens valuable settlement spots
- Blocks RED's expansion

Analyzing the map structure, I note that important road edges that could extend my network are:
- Edge (20, 22) [option 3] - Could help connect segments
- Edge (22, 49) [option 4] - Could extend toward the wheat port and potentially increase road length

Since longest road is currently tied at 6 segments, building a strategic road could potentially give me the longest road bonus (+2 VP), which would be a significant swing (bringing me to 6 VP and RED down to 5 VP).

## Decision
Looking at the map connectivity, I believe option 4 (edge 22, 49) provides the best opportunity to:
1. Potentially claim longest road by extending my network
2. Move toward the 2:1 wheat port (nodes 52, 53) which could be valuable
3. Extend into an area where RED hasn't yet expanded

<plan>
1. Build a road at edge (22, 49) to try to claim longest road bonus (+2 VP)
2. On future turns, continue expanding toward the wheat port
3. Focus on gathering resources for city upgrades (need ore and wheat)
4. Look for opportunities to place additional settlements
5. Monitor RED's progress and be ready to block their expansion
</plan>

I'll build a road at edge (22, 49), which costs my 1 wood and 1 brick.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and determine the best action for this turn.

## Victory Point Situation
- BLUE (me): 6 VP (4 settlements + longest road bonus)
- RED: 7 VP (3 settlements + 2 cities)
- I need 4 more points to win

## Resource Analysis
I currently have:
- 2 Wood
- 4 Sheep
- 2 Wheat
- 0 Brick
- 0 Ore

## Strategic Options

Looking at my current plan, I wanted to build a road at edge (22, 49) to maintain/extend my longest road bonus. However, I don't have any brick resources, which are needed for road building, so I cannot build a road this turn.

Let's consider what I can build with my current resources:
- Settlement (1 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat, 1 sheep): Not possible without brick
- Road (1 wood, 1 brick): Not possible without brick
- City (2 wheat, 3 ore): Not possible without ore
- Development Card (1 wheat, 1 sheep, 1 ore): Not possible without ore

My only options this turn are to:
1. End my turn without building anything
2. Trade resources using maritime trading

## Trading Analysis

With 4 sheep, I could use the 4:1 maritime trade to get one of the resources I need.
- If I trade for brick, I could build a road next turn
- If I trade for ore, I'd still need more ore for any meaningful build
- Trading for more wood or wheat isn't immediately helpful

Given that my current plan emphasizes maintaining longest road, and RED has a road network that could potentially challenge my longest road (they have 7 segments as well), obtaining brick seems most strategic.

<plan>
1. Trade 4 sheep for 1 brick this turn
2. Next turn, build a road at edge (22, 49) to secure longest road bonus
3. Continue expanding toward the wheat port
4. Focus on gathering resources (especially ore) for city upgrades
5. Monitor RED's progress and be ready to block their expansion
</plan>

Therefore, my best option is to trade 4 sheep for 1 brick.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Robber Placement

I need to carefully consider where to place the robber to maximize my strategic advantage while minimizing RED's chances of winning, as they already have 9 victory points.

## Critical Situation Assessment
- RED has 9 VP and needs just 1 more to win
- RED has the Longest Road bonus (8 segments, 2 VP)
- RED may have development cards or resources to build another settlement/upgrade to city
- I have only 4 VP and need to slow RED down while advancing my position

## Robber Placement Options Analysis

I should focus on placing the robber on a hex that:
1. Disrupts RED's high-productivity hexes (especially hexes producing ore/wheat for cities)
2. Affects multiple of RED's settlements/cities
3. Allows me to steal a potentially useful resource

Looking at RED's properties:
- 🏙️ at node 8: produces ⛏️3, 🧱8, 🌲9
- 🏙️ at node 16: produces 🌾3, 🐑6, 🌾5
- 🏠 at node 10: produces 🌾4, 🌲9, 🐑5
- 🏠 at node 14: produces 🌾6, 🧱4, ⛏️11
- 🏠 at node 40: produces 🌲10, 🌾5

The most valuable targets are:
- Hex 🌾6 (-1, 0, 1) [option 3]: High-value wheat (6 is a good roll) for RED's city at node 16
- Hex 🧱8 (2, -2, 0) [already blocked]: Currently has robber
- Hex 🌲9 (1, -2, 1) [option 7]: Good wood producer for RED's city at node 8 and settlement at node 10
- Hex 🌾5 (-1, 2, -1) [option 13]: Wheat producer for RED's city at node 16 and settlement at node 40

Since RED is at 9 VP, they likely need resources for one more build to win. Blocking wheat is critical as it's needed for both settlements and cities.

## Best Options:

1. Option 3: Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) [Wheat 6]
   - Blocks a high-probability wheat hex
   - Affects RED's settlement at node 14
   - Wheat is critical for RED's final push to victory

2. Option 13: Move robber to (-1, 2, -1) [Wheat 5]
   - Blocks wheat production for RED's city at node 16 and settlement at node 40
   - Affects multiple RED buildings

3. Option 4: Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) [Wheat 3]
   - Blocks wheat for RED's city at node 16
   - Lower probability number but still denies wheat

## Final Decision
Since RED is so close to winning, I need to block their most valuable resource. The best choice is option 3, as it blocks a high-probability wheat (6) hex that RED needs for their final build. This both disrupts RED's production and gives me a chance to steal a potentially valuable resource.

<plan>
1. Block RED's wheat production by placing the robber on the wheat 6 hex
2. Next turn, try to trade for brick to continue my road expansion
3. Focus on building toward the wheat port to improve my resource conversion options
4. Continue working toward longest road to take 2 VP from RED
5. Monitor RED's resources and be prepared to block again on future turns
</plan>

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan - Turn 78

Let me analyze the current game state and make the optimal decision.

## Board Analysis
- RED has 9/10 VP (7 VP from settlements/cities + 2 VP from longest road)
- BLUE (me) has only 4/10 VP (4 settlements)
- RED is just 1 point away from winning
- The robber is on a wheat 6 hex (-1, 0, 1)

## Resource Analysis
I have: 2 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK, 1 🐑SHEEP, 2 🌾WHEAT
This means I can potentially build a settlement if I use all my resources.

## Available Actions
- I can build a settlement at nodes 6, 22, 23, 49, 50, 51, or 52
- Each settlement would cost all my resources: 1🌲, 1🧱, 1🐑, 1🌾
- Or I can end my turn

## Strategic Considerations
1. RED is one point away from winning
2. Building a settlement would give me 1 VP (5/10 total)
3. I need to evaluate each settlement location based on:
   - Resources it would produce
   - Strategic position for future expansion
   - Potential to block RED's expansion

## Settlement Location Analysis

Node 6:
- Resources: 🌲8[⭐⭐⭐], ⛏️3[⭐], 🧱10[⭐]
- Excellent wood production, some brick and ore
- Close to my settlement at node 0

Node 22:
- Resources: 🧱10[⭐], ⛏️2[⭐], 🌲11[⭐]
- Low probability numbers (2, 10, 11)
- Near the 2:1 wheat port

Node 23:
- Resources: 🧱10[⭐], 🐑9[⭐⭐], ⛏️2[⭐]
- Decent sheep production, low probability for brick and ore
- Near the 2:1 wheat port

Node 49:
- Resources: ⛏️2[⭐], 🌲11[⭐]
- Only two resources with low probabilities
- Near general 3:1 port

Node 50:
- Resources: ⛏️2[⭐]
- Only one resource with very low probability
- Poor choice

Node 51:
- Resources: ⛏️2[⭐]
- Only one resource with very low probability
- Poor choice

Node 52:
- Resources: 🐑9[⭐⭐], ⛏️2[⭐]
- Decent sheep, low probability ore
- Access to the 2:1 wheat port

## Decision Making
Given that RED is at 9 VP and about to win, my move needs to be impactful. Building a settlement gives me 1 VP and uses all my resources. The best location would be where I get:
1. Good resource production
2. Strategic positioning for future growth
3. Potential to block RED

Node 6 stands out with its high-probability wood production (8) and additional resources. It's connected to my existing network and gives me access to multiple resource types.

Node 23 is also reasonable for sheep production, but Node 6 offers better overall production with the 8 for wood.

<plan>
1. Build settlement at node 6 to gain 1 VP and secure strong wood production
2. Focus on expanding my road network to challenge RED for longest road
3. Aim to build more settlements, especially near productive hexes or useful ports
4. Block RED whenever possible by competing for key locations
5. Be prepared to use the robber strategically on future turns
</plan>

Given RED is about to win, I need to make progress toward victory. Building a settlement at node 6 gives me the best resource production and advances my position.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 0 | Player: BLUE | Action: BUILD_INITIAL_SETTLEMENT

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build settlement at node 6 to gain 1 VP and secure strong wood production
2. Focus on expanding my road network to challenge RED for longest road
3. Aim to build more settlements, especially near productive hexes or useful ports
4. Block RED whenever possible by competing for key locations
5. Be prepared to use the robber strategically on future turns

# Initial Settlement Analysis for Settlers of Catan

I need to choose an optimal location for my first settlement. This is a critical decision that will impact the entire game. Let me analyze the best options by examining resource production potential, number probabilities, and future expansion opportunities.

## Analyzing High-Value Locations

I'll first look for settlements that give me access to high-probability numbers (6 and 8) on diverse resources:

### Locations with 6 and 8 numbers:
- Node 0: Connected to 🌾10, 🧱6, ⛏️3 (no 6/8)
- Node 1: Connected to 🌾10, 🧱6, 🐑8 (has an 8)
- Node 6: Connected to 🧱6, 🐑8, 🌾8 (has two 8s!)
- Node 20: Connected to ⛏️3, 🧱6, 🧱9 (has a 6)
- Node 22: Connected to 🧱6, 🧱9, 🐑6 (has a 6)
- Node 23: Connected to 🧱6, 🌾8, 🐑6 (has a 6 and an 8)

## Best Options Analysis

Node 6 stands out immediately as it provides access to:
- 🌾8 (Wheat with probability 8)
- 🧱6 (Brick with probability 6)
- 🐑8 (Sheep with probability 8)

This gives me:
1. Two high-value "8" rolls (very productive)
2. A "6" roll (also high-value)
3. Three different resources (brick, wheat, sheep)
4. Access near the 🌲 Wood port (at nodes 52, 53)
5. Good positioning for future expansion

Node 23 is also excellent with:
- 🌾8 (Wheat with probability 8)
- 🧱6 (Brick with probability 6)
- 🐑6 (Sheep with probability 6)

But Node 6 has two "8" numbers versus Node 23's one "8" and one "6", making Node 6 slightly better for production.

## Strategic Considerations

For my initial settlement:
- Node 6 gives me the strongest overall resource production
- It provides vital building resources (brick for roads)
- It's well-positioned for expansion in multiple directions
- For my second settlement, I should aim for ore and wood resources to complement this first placement
- Access to wheat (8) will help with city upgrades later

1. Build first settlement at node 6 to secure two 8s and one 6 production numbers
2. For second settlement, look for ore and wood production to complement
3. Start expanding toward wood/brick or ore/wheat production areas
4. Target either longest road or development card strategy depending on resource flow
</plan>

Based on my analysis, placing my first settlement at node 6 is optimal as it secures excellent production on three different resources.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

RESPONSE:
# Initial Road Placement Analysis

I need to place my first road extending from my settlement at node 6. This initial road placement is critical as it will determine my early expansion options.

Let me analyze each option carefully:

## Option [0]: Build a road at edge (6, 23)
This road would extend toward the east/southeast direction from my settlement. Looking at the board:
- It leads toward node 23, which connects to:
  - 🌾 Wheat (8) - excellent number
  - 🧱 Brick (6) - good number
  - 🐑 Sheep (6) - good number
- It also potentially leads toward the 2:1 Wood port (nodes 52, 53)

## Option [1]: Build a road at edge (1, 6)
This road extends to the northeast:
- It leads toward node 1, which connects to:
  - 🌾 Wheat (10) - decent number
  - 🐑 Sheep (8) - excellent number
  - 🌾 Wheat (4) - poor number

## Option [2]: Build a road at edge (6, 7)
This road extends to the north:
- It leads toward node 7, which connects to:
  - 🐑 Sheep (8) - excellent number
  - 🐑 Sheep (5) - average number
  - 🌾 Wheat (8) - excellent number

## Strategic Considerations:
1. I already have excellent sheep, wheat, and brick production from my settlement.
2. I'm missing ore and wood, which will be important for my overall strategy.
3. My first settlement is in a strong position with two 8s and one 6, providing high-probability production.
4. For my second settlement, I'll want to secure ore and wood if possible.

<plan>
1. Place my first road toward node 23, which opens pathways to good expansion options
2. For my second settlement, prioritize finding a location with ore and wood
3. After initial placements, focus on getting 1-2 more settlements built before upgrading to cities
4. Monitor the board for opportunities for either longest road or development card strategy
</plan>

Option [0] provides the most strategic value because:
1. It opens paths toward both ore-producing hexes and wood-producing hexes
2. It gives me a pathway toward the 2:1 wood port, which could be valuable
3. It provides the most flexibility for future expansion
4. The nodes it leads toward have good production values (8, 6, 6)

Therefore, I'll choose option 0.

\boxed{0}

# Initial Settlement Placement Analysis

I'm planning the second initial settlement placement, which is critical for the game's trajectory. Let's analyze the options methodically:

## Current Assessment
- My first settlement is at node 6, producing sheep (8), brick (6), and wheat (8) - strong numbers
- RED player has settlements at nodes 9 and 20
- Per initial placement strategy, I should:
  1. Target different high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on resources I don't have
  2. Aim for resource diversity (I need wood and ore)
  3. Place on opposite side of the board from my first settlement
  4. Position for future expansion

## Node-by-Node Analysis of Best Options

**Node 13** (connects to ⛏️5, ⛏️11, 🌲3):
- Resources: Complements my first settlement with ore and wood
- Numbers: 5, 11, 3 (moderate to low probability)
- Access to ore port at nodes 32-33
- Opposite side of board from first settlement
- Future expansion potential to nodes 12, 14, 34

**Node 14** (connects to ⛏️5, 🌲3, 🐑12):
- Resources: Adds ore and wood to my portfolio
- Numbers: 5, 3, 12 (moderate to very low probability)
- Between sheep port and ore spots
- Good position opposite to first settlement

**Node 22** (connects to 🧱6, 🐑6, 🧱9):
- Resources: More brick and sheep (already have both)
- Numbers: 6, 6, 9 (excellent probability)
- Near wheat port
- Not ideal - redundant resources

**Node 34** (connects to ⛏️5, ⛏️11, 🧱2):
- Resources: Ore and brick
- Numbers: 5, 11, 2 (moderate to low probability)
- Near ore port
- Lacks wood completely

**Node 35** (connects to ⛏️5, 🐑12):
- Resources: Ore and sheep
- Direct access to sheep port
- Limited production potential (only two hexes)
- Not recommended

## Final Decision Logic

Node 13 is the strongest option because:
1. It provides the missing resources (ore and wood)
2. It's positioned on the opposite side of the board from my first settlement
3. It offers decent production potential with three resource hexes
4. It provides access to the ore port
5. It has strong expansion opportunities 
6. It works well with my strategic plan to build settlements before cities

<plan>
1. Place second settlement at node 13 to secure wood and ore resources
2. Use first settlement's strong production (sheep, brick, wheat) combined with second settlement's wood and ore to enable flexible building
3. Early priority: Build 1-2 more settlements to secure additional resource production
4. Mid-game: Focus on upgrading my settlements to cities
5. Monitor opportunities for longest road or development cards based on resource availability
</plan>

Based on this analysis, the optimal choice for my second initial settlement is:

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Initial Road Placement

I need to carefully consider my initial road placement from my settlement at node 13, as this will determine my early expansion opportunities.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have two settlements:
  - Settlement at node 6: Excellent production (8-sheep, 6-brick, 8-wheat - all high probability)
  - Settlement at node 13: Decent production (3-wood, 11-ore, 5-ore)
- Resources in hand: 1 wood, 2 ore
- The robber is currently on the desert hex, not affecting production

## Road Options Analysis
I have three options for my initial road placement from node 13:

**[0] Edge (13, 14)** - Direction: Northwest
- Leads toward the ore port (nodes 32, 33)
- Moves toward ore hex (5) and sheep hex (12)
- Could eventually connect to my other settlement if needed
- Gives access to potential settlement at node 14 (produces ore-5, wood-3, sheep-12)

**[1] Edge (12, 13)** - Direction: South
- Leads toward the center of the board
- Connects toward wheat-4 and brick-2 hexes
- Could provide access to more resource diversity
- Points away from both ports and my other settlement

**[2] Edge (13, 34)** - Direction: Northeast
- Leads toward the ore port (nodes 32, 33)
- Provides direct access to the ore port which complements my ore production
- Moves along the edge with ore hex (5 and 11)
- Potential settlement at node 34 (produces ore-5, ore-11)

## Strategic Considerations
1. Resource diversity: I already have access to all resources except brick from my settlements
2. Port access: The ore port would be valuable given my strong ore production at node 13
3. Future expansion: Need to place road in direction of valuable settlement locations
4. Blocking opponents: Should consider positions that could block RED's expansion

## Decision Logic
Option [2] provides the best strategic value because:
- It moves directly toward the ore port, which will let me trade my excess ore efficiently
- Since I already have strong ore production (5 and 11), getting the 2:1 ore port would be highly valuable
- Node 34 would be a good settlement location (adding more ore production)
- This creates a strong specialized strategy focusing on ore/wheat for city upgrades
- The road doesn't lead me to compete with RED player directly

<plan>
1. Build initial road toward ore port (edge 13-34)
2. Next priority: secure ore port access with another road (34-33)
3. Expand with new settlement at node 33/34 near ore port
4. Use first settlement's strong production (sheep, brick, wheat) combined with second settlement's ore focus
5. Create ore/wheat engine for city upgrades
6. Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities
7. Monitor opportunities for largest army through development cards based on strong ore/wheat resources
</plan>

This approach gives me a clear resource strategy (ore/wheat focus) with a path to victory through cities and development cards.

# Game Analysis - Turn 4 BLUE

Let me analyze the current game state and available options to make the optimal strategic decision.

## Current Resources
I have 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 sheep, 1 wheat, and 2 ore.

## Current Position Assessment
- I have 2 settlements (2 VPs)
- Settlement at node 6: excellent production (three 6-8 numbers) on sheep, brick, and wheat
- Settlement at node 13: decent ore production (5 & 11), but weak wood (3)
- My current plan focuses on accessing the ore port via node 33/34
- I'm currently positioned well for ore production needed for city upgrades

## Available Actions Analysis

1. **Build a road** (1 wood, 1 brick): I have the exact resources needed for one road
   - Option 7 (edge 33-34) directly advances my plan to reach the ore port
   - Option 4 (edge 34-35) would go toward the sheep port instead
   - Other road options don't align with my immediate plan

2. **Buy a development card** (1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore): I have these resources
   - Could yield a knight, VP, or helpful action card
   - Would use my sheep and wheat, which I need to accumulate for other builds

3. **End turn**: Save resources for future builds
   - Risky due to potential 7 rolls and resource theft

## Decision Reasoning

Following my current plan, building the road from node 34 to node 33 (option 7) is optimal because:

1. It directly advances toward the ore port, which complements my strong ore production
2. The ore port will be very valuable since I already have good ore production (5 & 11)
3. Node 33 is a potential settlement location connected to the ore port
4. This move maintains my plan's progression without deviation

The development card is tempting, but building this key road is more important for securing the ore port access. Once I have the port secured with a settlement, development cards will become more valuable with my enhanced trading power.

<plan>
1. Build road to reach ore port at edge 33-34 (this turn)
2. Continue expanding toward ore port, aiming for settlement at node 33
3. Use first settlement's strong production (sheep, brick, wheat) combined with second settlement's ore focus and the ore port
4. Create ore/wheat engine for city upgrades
5. Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities
6. Monitor opportunities for largest army through development cards
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Turn 4

Let me carefully evaluate the current game state and my available options.

## Resource Assessment
- I have: 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 2 ⛏️ORE
- Available actions: Buy development card (costs 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE) or End Turn

## Board Position Analysis
- I have 2 settlements (2 VPs)
- My first settlement at node 6 is on excellent numbers (🐑8, 🧱6, 🌾8)
- My second settlement at node 13 is on weaker numbers but provides ore access
- I have a road to the ore port at edge 33-34, aligned with my plan
- Red has 6 hidden resources, potentially preparing for a significant build

## Strategic Considerations
1. **Development Card Option**:
   - Would cost all my resources except 1 ⛏️ORE
   - Potential benefits: Could be a Victory Point, Knight (for robber control/largest army), Road Building, Year of Plenty, or Monopoly
   - Knights are valuable for protecting my high-production settlement at node 6
   - Hidden VP cards accumulate without opponents' knowledge

2. **End Turn Option**:
   - I would save my resources for future turns
   - With my high-producing settlement, I'll likely gain more resources next turn
   - Could enable building a settlement at node 33 (ore port) sooner

## Decision Logic
My current plan focuses on continuing expansion toward the ore port and building a settlement there. The development card would deplete my resources, potentially delaying my settlement at the ore port.

However, a development card offers strategic flexibility and potential hidden victory points. Since I can only reach 1 VP at node 33 in the near future anyway, diversification through a development card makes sense. It could provide immediate utility (Knight, Road Building) or hidden progress toward victory.

The ore port settlement remains valuable, but I can still work toward it in subsequent turns. Maintaining a flexible strategy by adding a development card to my options seems optimal.

<plan>
1. Buy development card this turn to diversify strategy
2. Continue expanding toward ore port in future turns, aiming for settlement at node 33
3. Use settlement's strong production (sheep, brick, wheat) + ore focus with ore port
4. Create ore/wheat engine for city upgrades
5. Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities while using development cards strategically
6. Monitor opportunities for largest army through development cards

❓ Select action by number (0-1):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state and options to determine the optimal action.

## Current Game State Analysis
- I have 2 victory points (2 settlements)
- I have 1 hidden VP from a development card (total of 3 VP)
- Resources: 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore
- My opponent has 2 VP and 5 hidden resources
- Board position: I have good production at node 6 (sheep/brick/wheat all on high numbers)
- I'm positioned near the ore port at node 33

## Available Options
1. Buy a development card (costs 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore)
2. End turn

## Option Analysis

**Option 1: Buy Development Card**
- Pros:
  - Uses all my current resources (preventing robber loss)
  - Could be a knight (moves robber, helps for largest army)
  - Could be a Victory Point card (hidden until needed)
  - Could be a useful action card (Monopoly, Road Building, Year of Plenty)
  - Aligns with my current plan
- Cons:
  - Delays expansion toward ore port in the short term

**Option 0: End Turn**
- Pros:
  - Save resources for future builds
- Cons:
  - Risk losing resources to robber if I roll 7
  - No progress this turn
  - No clear benefit to holding these specific resources

## Decision Process
With my current resources (sheep, wheat, ore), I can buy exactly one development card. This is an efficient use of my current resources as:
1. It removes risk of losing to robber
2. Development cards provide flexibility and hidden power
3. My current plan mentions buying a development card for strategic diversity

My current plan is sound - focusing on the ore port will give me a strong ore/wheat engine for cities. The development card purchase complements this plan by potentially giving me a VP, knight, or utility card.

<plan>
1. Buy development card this turn
2. Continue expanding toward ore port in future turns, aiming for settlement at node 33
3. Use settlement's strong production + ore port for trading
4. Create ore/wheat engine for city upgrades
5. Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities while using development cards strategically
6. Monitor opportunities for largest army through development cards
</plan>

The optimal choice is to buy a development card:

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 8 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Buy development card this turn
2. Continue expanding toward ore port in future turns, aiming for settlement at node 33
3. Use settlement's strong production + ore port for trading
4. Create ore/wheat engine for city upgrades
5. Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities while using development cards strategically
6. Monitor opportunities for largest army through development cards

RESPONSE:
# Game State Analysis

Let's analyze the current game state:

## Current Status:
- I have 2 VP from my settlements
- I have 1 hidden VP from a development card
- I have no resources currently
- I have a Knight card available to play
- The robber is on Desert tile (0, 2, -2), so not affecting any resource production
- RED has 5 unknown resources, and 2 VP from settlements

## Knight Card Analysis:
Playing the Knight card would:
1. Allow me to move the robber to block a resource hex
2. Let me steal a resource from RED (who has 5 cards)
3. Contribute toward Largest Army (2 VP) if I play 3+ knights

## Roll Dice Analysis:
If I roll:
- I will get resources based on the roll from my settlements
- I can then build, trade, or buy development cards after getting resources
- But there's a risk of rolling 7 and activating the robber

## Strategic Evaluation:
- I have no resources currently, so rolling will give me resources to work with
- Playing Knight now doesn't advance my position significantly since:
  - No one is close to winning (both at 2 visible VP)
  - No one is currently threatening my expansion path toward node 33
  - RED's hand isn't excessively large to justify targeting yet

<plan>
1. Roll dice to collect resources this turn
2. Continue expanding toward ore port at node 33
3. Use settlement's strong production + ore port for trading
4. Create ore/wheat engine for city upgrades
5. Save Knight card for when it provides more strategic value
6. Monitor opportunities for largest army through development cards
</plan>

Since I have no resources currently, and the game is still in early stages, rolling the dice is the optimal move to collect resources and advance my position.

# Game Analysis for Current Turn

Let me carefully analyze the current game state and available actions to make the optimal decision.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 2 victory points (2 settlements)
- I have 1 hidden victory point from a development card
- Resources: 1 ORE only
- Development cards: 1 KNIGHT, 1 VICTORY_POINT
- Settlements at node 6 (excellent production: sheep 8, brick 6, wheat 8) and node 13 (ore 11, ore 5, wood 3)
- I've built roads toward the ore port at node 33 (as per my plan)
- Opponent has 2 settlements (2 VP) and 5 hidden resources

## Available Actions Analysis
1. **Play Knight card** - This would move the robber and let me steal a resource from Red
2. **End turn** - Do nothing and pass to the next player

## Decision Analysis

**Option 0: Play Knight Card**
- Benefits:
  - Move robber from desert (no impact currently) to block a productive hex for Red
  - Steal one of Red's 5 resources
  - Start building toward largest army (need 3 knights total)
- Drawbacks:
  - Knights are more valuable when protecting my own high-value hexes
  - Red doesn't appear close to winning yet (only 2 VP visible)
  - I have very limited resources (just 1 ore), so I can't capitalize much on what I steal

**Option 1: End Turn**
- Benefits:
  - Save Knight card for when I need to protect my valuable 6/8 hexes or when I'm close to largest army
  - Maintain current strategy focused on expansion toward ore port
- Drawbacks:
  - Miss opportunity to potentially gain a useful resource from Red

## Strategic Reasoning
My current plan is solid, focusing on the ore port and building an ore/wheat engine for city upgrades. Playing the Knight now would be somewhat premature when:
1. The robber is on the desert (not hurting anyone)
2. I don't have enough resources to build anything significant this turn regardless
3. Knight cards are more valuable for protection and largest army later in the game

<plan>
1. Continue expanding toward ore port at node 33
2. Use settlement's strong production + ore port for trading
3. Build settlement at node 32 to capitalize on the ore port
4. Create ore/wheat engine for city upgrades
5. Save Knight card for when it provides more strategic value (protecting 6/8 hexes)
6. Monitor opportunities for largest army through development cards
</plan>

Given these considerations, I believe the optimal action is to end my turn and wait for better opportunities to use my Knight card.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 10 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Continue expanding toward ore port at node 33
2. Use settlement's strong production + ore port for trading
3. Build settlement at node 32 to capitalize on the ore port
4. Create ore/wheat engine for city upgrades
5. Save Knight card for when it provides more strategic value (protecting 6/8 hexes)
6. Monitor opportunities for largest army through development cards

# Game Analysis

I'll analyze the available actions to determine the best strategic move.

## Current Game State
- I have 2 VP (2 settlements) and a hidden Victory Point card (so effectively 3 VP)
- Resources: 1 Wood, 1 Ore
- Development cards: 1 Knight, 1 Victory Point
- Robber is on the desert hex, not blocking any production
- Red has 6 hidden resource cards

## Available Actions
- [0] Play Knight card - Move robber and steal a resource
- [1] Roll the dice

## Action Analysis

### Option 0: Play Knight
- **Benefits**:
  - Could block Red's best production (likely the 8 sheep or 6 brick)
  - Could steal one of Red's 6 resources
  - Would be my first move toward Largest Army (need 3 knights total)
- **Drawbacks**:
  - I have very few resources (only 1 wood, 1 ore)
  - Knight cards can be more valuable mid-game when protecting high-value hexes
  - Playing now doesn't align with any immediate build opportunity

### Option 1: Roll the Dice
- **Benefits**:
  - Could produce more resources to enable building
  - My settlements produce on good numbers (8, 6, 5, 11, 3)
  - Rolling gives me a chance to advance my plans for expansion
  - Can save the Knight card for more strategic use later
- **Drawbacks**:
  - Unpredictable outcome
  - Red has many resources and might be able to build after my roll

## Strategic Considerations
- My current plan is to expand toward the ore port at node 33
- I already have a road at 34-33, so I'm positioned near the ore port
- With only 1 wood and 1 ore, I can't build anything significant yet
- Rolling could give me resources needed for expansion
- Knight card is more valuable when used strategically to:
  1. Protect my high-value hexes from the robber
  2. Block opponent's important production when they're close to building
  3. Secure Largest Army later in the game

<plan>
1. Continue focus on ore port expansion
2. Roll now to gather resources for building
3. Save Knight card for more strategic use (when Red threatens or when I need to protect key hexes)
4. Build toward settlement at node 32 when resources allow
5. Consider development card strategy for late game (Knights for Largest Army)
</plan>

## Decision
Given my limited resources and the fact that the robber isn't currently affecting my production, rolling the dice is the better option. Playing the Knight now wouldn't enable any immediate builds, and I should save it for a more impactful moment.

# Analysis of Game State and Available Options

Let me analyze my current position and options:

**Current Resources**: 1 Wood and 1 Ore
**Development Cards**: 1 Knight, 1 Victory Point (hidden, worth 1 VP)
**Current Victory Points**: 2 visible + 1 hidden = 3 VP total
**Opponent**: Red has 7 cards (at risk of losing half if a 7 is rolled)

## Option Analysis:

### Option 0: Play Knight Card
- Advantages:
  - Move the robber away from the desert (which doesn't affect anyone)
  - Could steal a resource from Red who has many cards
  - Start working toward Largest Army (need 3 knights total)
  - Protect myself in case I roll a 7 next turn
  
- Disadvantages:
  - Generally better to save knights for more strategic timing
  - With only Wood+Ore I can't build anything significant next turn anyway
  - Red hasn't been particularly threatening yet
  - The robber isn't currently blocking any of my resources

### Option 1: End Turn
- Advantages:
  - Save Knight card for a more strategic situation
  - Next turn I'll roll and potentially get more resources
  - No immediate threat requiring Knight usage
  
- Disadvantages:
  - Red has 7 cards and might make significant progress with them

## Strategic Considerations:
1. I don't have immediate building plans with just wood+ore
2. Red has 7 cards which is concerning, but playing Knight now won't stop their current plans
3. More effective to save Knight for when:
   - Red is closer to winning
   - When my key production hexes get blocked
   - When I need a specific resource Red has

<plan>
1. Roll now to gather resources
2. Continue focus on expansion toward ore port (node 32/33)
3. Save Knight card for when Red threatens key hexes or is advancing quickly
4. Work toward building settlement at node 32 which connects to the ore port
5. Consider development card strategy for late game (Knights for Largest Army)
6. Monitor Red's expansion and potentially use robber to slow them down if they advance too quickly
</plan>

My current resources are minimal, and there's no immediate threat requiring Knight usage. The Knight card will be more valuable later when I can strategically place the robber to protect my high-value hexes or disrupt Red's progress. I'll end my turn now and roll to gather more resources next turn.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

  Play Knight Card:

    [1] Roll the dice

❓ Select action by number (0-1):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I need to decide whether to roll the dice (action 1) or play my Knight card (action 0).

Let's analyze the game state:

**Current Resources**:
- I have 1 wood and 2 ore
- I have a Knight card and a Victory Point card (hidden)
- Red has 7 cards (at the maximum limit)

**Current Board Position**:
- Both players have 2 victory points (2 settlements each)
- I have roads extending toward the ore port (nodes 32/33)
- Red is likely to lose resources if a 7 is rolled since they have 7 cards
- The robber is currently on the desert hex (0,2,-2)

**Strategic Considerations**:
1. **Dice Roll Benefits**:
   - Rolling now could produce more resources (especially from my productive settlement at node 6)
   - If I roll a 7, Red would have to discard half their cards, which would slow them down
   
2. **Knight Card Benefits**:
   - Playing Knight now would let me move the robber to a tile producing resources for Red
   - I could steal one of Red's 7 cards
   - It would contribute to the Largest Army (need 3 knights)
   - Save my current resources from potential robber placement if Red rolls a 7

Since my current plan involves saving the Knight card for when Red threatens key hexes, and I also want to gather resources through rolling, I should follow the plan. Red doesn't seem to be in an immediate position to threaten me, and I need more resources to continue my expansion.

Also, rolling now might give me a 7, forcing Red to discard half their cards, which would be advantageous without using my Knight. If I don't roll a 7, I'll gain resources that can help me build toward my goal of reaching node 32/33.

<plan>
1. Roll now to gather resources
2. Continue focus on expansion toward ore port (node 32/33)
3. Save Knight card for when Red threatens key hexes or when I need to protect a large hand
4. Work toward building settlement at node 32 which connects to the ore port
5. Consider development card strategy for late game (Knights for Largest Army)
6. Monitor Red's expansion and potentially use robber to slow them down if they advance too quickly
</plan>

Therefore, I choose to roll the dice.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current board state and my available options:

## Resource Assessment
I have: 1 🌲WOOD, 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 2 ⛏️ORE
Red has 8 cards (hidden) - this is above the 7-card threshold, making them vulnerable to the robber.

## Victory Point Status
- Me (Blue): 2/10 VP visible (2 settlements), plus 1 hidden VP card = 3/10 VP total
- Red: 2/10 VP visible (2 settlements)

## Available Actions
0. Play Knight card - Move the robber and steal a resource
1. End my turn
2. Buy a development card (1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE)

## Strategic Analysis:

### Option 0: Play Knight Card
- Advantages:
  - Can steal from Red who has 8 cards
  - Can move the robber from the desert to block Red's high-producing hexes
  - Contributes toward Largest Army (2 VP)
- Disadvantages:
  - I may need the Knight card later when I have more resources to protect

### Option 1: End Turn
- Advantages:
  - Preserves my resources and development card for later
- Disadvantages:
  - Misses opportunity to potentially disrupt Red who has many cards

### Option 2: Buy Development Card
- Advantages:
  - Could get another VP card or useful action card
  - Reduces my hand size, protecting against robber
- Disadvantages:
  - I would spend most of my resources
  - Would make it harder to build toward the ore port (node 32/33)
  - Current plan prioritizes expansion over development cards

## Decision Logic:
Red has 8 cards, which is significant. Playing the Knight now would:
1. Let me steal one of Red's resources
2. Move the robber to block one of Red's productive hexes (likely the 🐑8 or 🧱6)
3. Begin my path toward Largest Army

Looking at my current plan, I'm focusing on expansion toward the ore port. I don't have enough resources to make significant progress on that yet, so playing the Knight now makes strategic sense to slow Red while advancing my own Largest Army strategy.

<plan>
1. Play Knight now to steal from Red and block their high-producing hex
2. Continue focus on expansion toward ore port (node 32/33) as resources permit
3. Begin working toward Largest Army as secondary victory path
4. Work toward building settlement at node 32 which connects to the ore port
5. Monitor Red's expansion and continue to use robber strategically
</plan>

The optimal play is to use my Knight card now, as Red has a large hand and I can begin working toward Largest Army.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 12 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Play Knight now to steal from Red and block their high-producing hex
2. Continue focus on expansion toward ore port (node 32/33) as resources permit
3. Begin working toward Largest Army as secondary victory path
4. Work toward building settlement at node 32 which connects to the ore port
5. Monitor Red's expansion and continue to use robber strategically

# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to place the robber strategically to maximize my advantage while hindering my opponent. Let's analyze the options systematically.

## Step 1: Analyze opponent's position
Red has settlements at nodes 9 and 20 with the following production:
- Node 9: 🐑8[⭐⭐⭐], 🌾4[⭐], 🌲10[⭐]
- Node 20: ⛏️3[⭐], 🧱6[⭐⭐⭐], 🧱9[⭐⭐]

The high-producing hexes for Red are:
- 🐑8 (1, -1, 0) - 3 pips, very valuable
- 🧱6 (1, 0, -1) - 3 pips, very valuable
- 🧱9 (1, 1, -2) - 2 pips, moderately valuable

## Step 2: Consider my position
I have settlements at nodes 6 and 13 with the following production:
- Node 6: 🐑8[⭐⭐⭐], 🧱6[⭐⭐⭐], 🌾8[⭐⭐⭐]
- Node 13: 🌲3[⭐], ⛏️11[⭐], ⛏️5[⭐⭐]

I need to be careful not to block resources I need myself.

## Step 3: Evaluate robber placement options
The most impactful options that target Red's high-producing hexes:
- Option [1]: Move to (1, -1, 0) - Blocks Red's 🐑8 (3 pips)
- Option [6]: Move to (1, 0, -1) - Blocks Red's 🧱6 (3 pips)
- Option [15]: Move to (1, 1, -2) - Blocks Red's 🧱9 (2 pips)

However, option [1] would also block my own 🐑8 production at node 6, which is very valuable to me.
Option [6] would block 🧱6 which produces for both me and Red.

## Step 4: Consider Red's resources
Red has 8 hidden resources, which suggests they might be saving up for something significant. Blocking their high-producing hexes and stealing from them could disrupt their plans.

## Step 5: Strategic considerations
Looking at my plan, I want to expand toward the ore port at node 32/33. To do this, I'll need more ore, wood, and brick. I should avoid blocking my own ore production and consider blocking resources Red might need for expansion.

## Decision
The best option is [1] - placing the robber on the 🐑8 hex at (1, -1, 0). While this blocks my own sheep production too, it's strategically sound because:
1. It targets Red's high-value 3-pip hex
2. I already have 1 sheep in my hand
3. This blocks Red's access to sheep which they likely need for settlements
4. I get to steal a resource from Red, potentially disrupting their plans

<plan>
1. Place robber on sheep hex to disrupt Red's expansion and steal a resource
2. Continue focus on expansion toward ore port (node 32/33) as resources permit
3. If I steal brick or wood, consider road building toward the ore port
4. Work toward Largest Army as secondary victory path
5. Look for opportunities to build a settlement at node 32 which connects to the ore port

TURN 12 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Place robber on sheep hex to disrupt Red's expansion and steal a resource
2. Continue focus on expansion toward ore port (node 32/33) as resources permit
3. If I steal brick or wood, consider road building toward the ore port
4. Work toward Largest Army as secondary victory path
5. Look for opportunities to build a settlement at node 32 which connects to the ore port

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze my current position in this Catan game:

## Victory Points
- I have 2 visible VP (2 settlements)
- I have 1 hidden VP (development card)
- I have played 1 Knight card

## Resources
I currently have:
- 1 🌲 WOOD
- 1 🐑 SHEEP
- 2 🌾 WHEAT
- 2 ⛏️ ORE

## Strategic Position
- I have settlements at nodes 6 and 13
- My road network extends toward the ore port (nodes 33, 34)
- I don't currently have enough resources to build a road or settlement
- The robber is on sheep-8, which is a high-value hex for both myself and Red
- Red has 7 cards, meaning they're vulnerable to the robber

## Available Actions
I have only two options:
1. Buy a development card (1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE)
2. End my turn

## Decision Analysis

Buying a development card would cost me 1 sheep, 1 wheat, and 1 ore, leaving me with just 1 wheat and 1 ore. The development card could be:
- Victory Point (immediately advancing me to 4 VP total)
- Knight (helping toward Largest Army)
- Year of Plenty (resource flexibility)
- Monopoly (resource accumulation)
- Road Building (free expansion)

All of these would be valuable. If I get a VP card, I'd be at 4 VP (with 3 hidden) - a strong position. A Knight would help toward Largest Army (2 VP). The other cards provide significant resource/building advantages.

Alternatively, ending my turn preserves my resources but doesn't advance my position. However, with my current resources, I can't build much else anyway.

<plan>
1. Continue buying strategic development cards toward hidden VP and Largest Army
2. Save resources for building toward the ore port (node 32/33)
3. If I draw a Knight, use it to move the robber away from my sheep-8 hex
4. Continue working toward 2-3 city upgrades while maintaining settlement expansion
5. Target node 32 for my next settlement, connecting to ore port
</plan>

The development card provides the best strategic value at this moment, potentially giving me a win condition (VP card) or tools to improve my position. I'll purchase a development card.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

# Game Analysis - Turn 14

I need to decide whether to roll the dice or play my Knight development card first.

## Current Game State
- I'm BLUE with 2 visible VP + 1 hidden VP from my VP development card = 3 VP total
- I have 2 🌲WOOD, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE
- I have 1 KNIGHT card available to play
- RED has 8 cards in hand (high probability of getting hit by the robber if they roll a 7)
- The robber is currently on the Sheep-8 hex, blocking one of my most productive hexes

## Option Analysis

**Option 0: Play Knight**
- Benefits: 
  - Move the robber from my valuable sheep-8 hex
  - Steal a resource from RED who has 8 cards
  - Step toward Largest Army (would have 2/3 Knights needed)
- Drawbacks:
  - Using the Knight now means I won't have it if someone rolls a 7 soon
  - I could save it for potentially more strategic timing

**Option 1: Roll Dice**
- Benefits:
  - Could get resources needed for development
  - Knight card remains available for future strategic use
- Drawbacks:
  - The robber stays on my valuable sheep-8 hex, limiting my resource production
  - If I roll a 7, I'd need to move the robber myself anyway

## Strategic Considerations
Looking at my current plan, I specifically mentioned: "If I draw a Knight, use it to move the robber away from my sheep-8 hex." I already have a Knight and the robber is indeed on my sheep-8 hex, which is one of my most productive hexes.

Playing the Knight now aligns with my current strategy. It will unblock my high-value sheep hex and potentially give me an extra resource from RED. RED having 8 cards means they likely have resources I could benefit from.

Additionally, this moves me closer to the Largest Army (2 VP), which is part of my path to victory.

<plan>
1. Play Knight to move robber off my sheep-8 hex and steal a resource from RED
2. Continue buying strategic development cards toward hidden VP and Largest Army
3. Save resources for building toward the ore port (node 32/33)
4. Continue working toward 2-3 city upgrades while maintaining settlement expansion
5. Target node 32 for my next settlement, connecting to ore port
</plan>

The optimal choice is to play my Knight development card.

# Analyzing the Robber Move Decision

I need to carefully evaluate where to place the robber to maximize my strategic advantage while hindering my opponent's progress.

## Current Game State
- I'm BLUE with 2 VP (plus 1 hidden VP card)
- RED has 2 VP with 8 hidden resource cards
- The robber is currently on (1, -1, 0) which is a Sheep-8 hex
- This is hurting me as my settlement at node 6 produces from this valuable Sheep-8 hex

## Evaluation Criteria for Robber Placement
1. Unblock my high-value resources
2. Block RED's high-value resources
3. Ability to steal a useful resource from RED
4. Strategic impact on future game development

## Analyzing Options

Let's examine RED's production:
- Settlement at node 9: 🐑8[⭐⭐⭐], 🌾4[⭐], 🌲10[⭐]
- Settlement at node 20: ⛏️3[⭐], 🧱6[⭐⭐⭐], 🧱9[⭐⭐]

RED is strong in brick production (🧱6 and 🧱9), which is valuable for roads and settlements. I should consider blocking one of these.

My options to steal from RED and block valuable resources:
- [1] Move to (0, -1, 1) - Blocks Wheat-4, affects RED's settlement at node 9
- [4] Move to (0, 1, -1) - Blocks Ore-3, affects RED's settlement at node 20
- [5] Move to (1, 0, -1) - Blocks Brick-6, affects both RED's settlements
- [7] Move to (1, -2, 1) - Blocks Wood-10, affects RED's settlement at node 9
- [15] Move to (1, 1, -2) - Blocks Brick-9, affects RED's settlement at node 20

Option [5] is particularly powerful as the Brick-6 hex is connected to both RED's settlements, providing them with valuable brick resources for expansion. By blocking this, I significantly hamper RED's ability to build roads and settlements.

Additionally, I need to consider what resources are most valuable to steal from RED. With 8 cards, RED is likely holding several brick resources that would benefit my expansion plans, especially since I'm planning to build toward the ore port (nodes 32/33).

<plan>
1. Move robber to Brick-6 hex to block RED's major brick production
2. Continue buying strategic development cards toward hidden VP and Largest Army
3. Use stolen resources (hopefully brick) to continue road building toward the ore port
4. Target node 32 for my next settlement to access the ore port
5. Work toward 2-3 city upgrades while maintaining settlement expansion
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I choose option [5], which will place the robber on the Brick-6 hex (1, 0, -1) and allow me to steal a resource from RED. This is optimal because:
- It blocks a highly productive hex for RED (Brick-6 with ⭐⭐⭐)
- It affects both of RED's settlements
- It blocks a resource RED needs for expansion
- It unblocks my Sheep-8 production
- I have a good chance to steal brick which I need for my expansion plan

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 16 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Move robber to Brick-6 hex to block RED's major brick production
2. Continue buying strategic development cards toward hidden VP and Largest Army
3. Use stolen resources (hopefully brick) to continue road building toward the ore port
4. Target node 32 for my next settlement to access the ore port
5. Work toward 2-3 city upgrades while maintaining settlement expansion
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.
  To adjust your plan, provide a NEW PLAN in your reasoning with <plan>your new plan</plan>

# Game Analysis for Blue Player

Let me analyze the current game state and available options for the Blue player on Turn 16.

## Current Situation Assessment
- I have 2 VP (2 settlements)
- 1 hidden victory point card (total 3 VP)
- Resources: 2 Wood, 1 Sheep, 3 Wheat, 2 Ore
- I've played 2 knight cards already (1 more for Largest Army)
- The robber is on the Brick-6 hex, blocking RED's major brick production (aligns with my plan)
- My settlements are at nodes 6 (Sheep-8, Brick-6, Wheat-8) and 13 (Wood-3, Ore-11, Ore-5)
- I have roads connecting toward node 33, which is adjacent to the Ore port

## Available Actions
1. Buy a development card (costs: 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore)
2. End turn

## Strategic Analysis

Looking at my development card strategy:
- I already have 1 VP development card (hidden)
- I've played 2 knights and need 1 more for Largest Army (2 VP)
- If I get another knight or VP card, I'd be at 4 VP with potential for 6 VP soon

Available resources check:
- I have exactly enough resources to buy 1 development card (1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore)
- After buying, I'd retain 2 Wood, 2 Wheat, 1 Ore

Looking at my future plans:
- I need to continue my road toward node 32 to access the ore port
- I want to eventually upgrade to cities (need more ore and wheat)
- Development cards offer flexibility (knights, resources, VP)

Red player has 9 hidden cards - they're likely planning a big build next turn. Getting another knight card could allow me to disrupt their plans if needed.

<plan>
1. Buy a development card now, hoping for a knight or VP card
2. Continue road building toward the ore port at node 32
3. Start saving for a city upgrade (need 3 ore, 2 wheat) after securing the ore port
4. Maintain knight cards for potential largest army (2 VP)
</plan>

Given all considerations, buying a development card now:
1. Advances my path toward Largest Army if I get a knight
2. Could provide an immediate VP card
3. Offers utility cards (Monopoly, Year of Plenty, Road Building) that could accelerate my plans
4. Doesn't leave me with too many cards for the robber

## Final Decision
I'll buy a development card to continue my strategy toward Largest Army and/or hidden VP.

# Game Analysis for Blue Player - Turn 18

I'll analyze the current game state and available actions to determine the optimal move.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 2 VP (2 settlements)
- I have 2 Wood, 2 Wheat resources
- I have 1 Year of Plenty card and 1 hidden Victory Point card
- I've played 2 knights (need 1 more for Largest Army bonus)
- Red has 2 VP as well, with 6 hidden resources
- Robber is on a wheat hex (2, -1, -1) which has an 8 value

## Resource Production Analysis
- My settlement at node 6: produces sheep(8), brick(6), wheat(8) - all high value!
- My settlement at node 13: produces wood(3), ore(11), ore(5) - decent ore production
- The robber is blocking a wheat hex that produces for me

## Strategic Position
- I have roads extending toward the ore port (nodes 33, 34)
- I have a hidden VP card, so I actually have 3 VP total
- My current plan focuses on development cards and the ore port

## Options Analysis
I can either:
1) Roll the dice
2) Play Year of Plenty card to get specific resources

### Option 1: Roll the dice
- Standard play, could get more resources
- Risk of rolling 7 with Red having 6 cards
- I don't have enough resources to build anything significant

### Option 2: Play Year of Plenty
- Can select any 2 resources which could enable an immediate build
- Best combinations would help me achieve my goals: city upgrade, road to ore port, or development card

## Decision Logic
Looking at my current resources (2 wood, 2 wheat) and strategic plan:

1. For a city upgrade: I need 3 ore + 2 wheat
   - I have 2 wheat already, need 3 ore
   - Year of Plenty for 2 ore would get me closer

2. For a new development card: I need 1 ore + 1 sheep + 1 wheat
   - I have 2 wheat already, need 1 ore + 1 sheep
   - Year of Plenty for ore+sheep would enable immediate development card purchase

3. For a road to the ore port: I need 1 wood + 1 brick
   - I have 2 wood already, need 1 brick
   - Year of Plenty for brick+something else would enable road building

Given my current plan to continue road building toward the ore port and then save for a city, the most efficient use of Year of Plenty would be:

<plan>
1. Use Year of Plenty for brick+ore to enable both road building and progress toward city
2. Build road toward ore port (node 32)
3. Continue saving for city upgrade (now needing 2 more ore, with 2 wheat already in hand)
4. Buy development cards when opportunity arises, aiming for knight or VP cards
</plan>

Among the available Year of Plenty options, option [6] - Play Year of Plenty card for brick+ore aligns perfectly with my strategic needs.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state and determine the optimal move.

## Current Game State Analysis

**My Position:**
- I have 2 VP from settlements and 1 hidden VP (development card), so actually 3/10 VP
- Resources: 2 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Sheep, 2 Wheat, 1 Ore
- Strong production: Sheep, Brick, Wheat from Settlement at node 6
- Decent Ore production from both settlements
- Have an Ore port connection opportunity (nodes 32, 33)

**Opponent Position:**
- RED has 2 VP from settlements
- RED has 7 hidden resource cards (at risk of robber)
- RED's production seems focused on Brick (high probability 6 and 9)

## Action Options Analysis

1. **Build Road Options (Actions 1-8)**
   - Most strategic direction is toward the Ore port (action 3) which aligns with our plan
   - But we'd use our only Brick, limiting immediate settlement options

2. **Build Settlement (Action 9)**
   - Building at node 33 would connect us to the Ore port
   - This is excellent for our resource strategy since we need Ore for cities
   - Costs 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Wheat, 1 Sheep - we have all these resources

3. **Buy Development Card (Action 10)**
   - Could yield VP, Knight, or other useful cards
   - Costs 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore - we have these resources
   - But development cards are less predictable than direct building

## Strategic Considerations

The settlement at node 33 is highly valuable because:
1. It connects us to the Ore port, giving 2:1 trade for Ore
2. This port will be crucial for city upgrades (need 3 Ore per city)
3. We already have a road built to enable this placement
4. It expands our territory and blocks RED from expanding there
5. Gives us an immediate +1 VP

Building this settlement also aligns with the balanced growth strategy - getting additional settlements before focusing on city upgrades.

## Updated Plan

<plan>
1. Build settlement at node 33 to gain VP and secure the Ore port
2. Use Ore port to facilitate city upgrades as we collect resources
3. Build roads toward promising locations with good numbers
4. Target city upgrades for nodes with high production values
5. Continue buying development cards opportunistically
</plan>

The settlement at node 33 is clearly the most valuable immediate action. It gives us a VP, secures the strategic Ore port, and expands our territory.

- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 22 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build settlement at node 33 to gain VP and secure the Ore port
2. Use Ore port to facilitate city upgrades as we collect resources
3. Build roads toward promising locations with good numbers
4. Target city upgrades for nodes with high production values
5. Continue buying development cards opportunistically

# Game Analysis for Turn 22

I'll analyze the current game state and determine the optimal move for my Blue player.

## Current Game Status
- I have 3 visible VP (3 settlements) + 1 hidden VP (development card) = 4 VP total
- Red has 2 visible VP (2 settlements)
- I have resources: 1 Wood, 1 Wheat, 2 Ore
- I have the Ore port (2:1)
- Robber is currently on a Wheat hex (2,-1,-1) that has an 8 value
- I have played 2 Knights, so I'm working toward Largest Army (need 1 more)

## Current Resource Analysis
With 1 Wood, 1 Wheat, and 2 Ore, I cannot:
- Build a new settlement (need Wood+Brick+Wheat+Sheep)
- Build a city (need 3 Ore + 2 Wheat, I'm short 1 Ore and 1 Wheat)
- Build a road (need Wood+Brick, I'm missing Brick)
- Buy a development card (need Ore+Wheat+Sheep, I'm missing Sheep)

## Maritime Trade Options Analysis
I have an Ore port (2:1), but the available trades listed are:
1. Trade 2 "None" for 1 Wheat
2. Trade 2 "None" for 1 Brick
3. Trade 2 "None" for 1 Sheep
4. Trade 2 "None" for 1 Wood

This is strange as the trades mention "None" resources. However, I believe this is referring to using my Ore port to trade 2 Ore for other resources. Since I have 2 Ore, I could potentially make one of these trades.

## Strategic Evaluation
Looking at my current position and plan:
1. I need to continue advancing toward 10 VP
2. I currently have 3 settlements - I should look to upgrade to cities (2 VP per city)
3. I've played 2 Knights - getting 1 more would give me Largest Army (2 VP)
4. I have access to the Ore port which is valuable for city building

To make progress toward my goals, I need:
- For city upgrade: 1 more Ore + 1 more Wheat
- For development card (hoping for Knight): Sheep + I'm ok on Ore and Wheat

## Action Analysis
Looking at the trade options:
- Option 1: Trade 2 Ore for 1 Wheat → This would give me 2 Wheat, still short on Ore for a city
- Option 2: Trade 2 Ore for 1 Brick → Not immediately useful (would still need Wood for a road)
- Option 3: Trade 2 Ore for 1 Sheep → Could help toward buying a development card, but would need more resources
- Option 4: Trade 2 Ore for 1 Wood → Not immediately useful

None of these trades creates an immediate build opportunity. I should consider:
1. What's most likely to advance my position next turn?
2. Which resource would be hardest to naturally obtain?

I note that getting a Wheat would prepare me better for either a city upgrade or development card on my next turn. With my Ore port, I can more easily convert future Ore into other resources.

## Decision
Since none of the trades enable an immediate build and I can't make substantial progress this turn, the best option is to end my turn and await better resource opportunities.

<plan>
1. End turn now and collect resources
2. Work toward city upgrades at high-value nodes (especially node 6 with three good numbers)
3. Buy development cards when possible, particularly for Knights to get Largest Army
4. Leverage the Ore port for strategic trades when I have excess Ore
5. Consider expansion to another settlement once I have upgraded at least one to a city
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

# Game Analysis for Turn 24

Let me carefully analyze the current game state and my available options to make the optimal decision.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 3 visible VP + 1 hidden VP card = 4 VP total
- Resources: 2 Wood, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 2 Ore
- I control the 2:1 Ore port
- The robber is on a Wheat hex (2,-1,-1) with probability 8, blocking one of my high-value hexes
- Red has 3 VP and 8 hidden resource cards

## Potential Victory Paths
1. **City Upgrade Path**: I need to upgrade my settlements to cities, especially my high-value settlement at node 6
2. **Largest Army Path**: I already have 2 knights played, need 1 more to get Largest Army (2 VP)
3. **Settlement Expansion Path**: Build roads and new settlements for additional points

## Available Actions Analysis
- [0] End turn: No immediate gain, but conserves resources
- [1] Buy a development card (1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore): Could be a knight, VP card, or utility card
- [2-5] Various port trades: I have access to the Ore port but none of these trades use that advantage

Let me evaluate each option:

### Option 0: End Turn
- Keeping my resources risks losing half if a 7 is rolled
- Red has 8 resources, high chance they'll build something powerful next turn
- No immediate progress toward victory

### Option 1: Buy Development Card
- Costs: 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore
- Remaining: 2 Wood, 1 Ore
- Benefits:
  - 25% chance for a VP card (immediate hidden point)
  - ~37.5% chance for a Knight (would give me Largest Army = 2 VP)
  - ~37.5% chance for utility card (Monopoly/Road Building/Year of Plenty)
  - Reduces hand size, lowering risk from robber
- Drawbacks:
  - Delays city upgrade plans
  - Could be a "wasted" draw if it's not immediately useful

### Port Trades (Options 2-5)
- None of these trades make efficient use of my resources
- I don't need to trade at standard port rates since I control the Ore port

## Strategic Reasoning
I'm currently at 4 VP (including my hidden VP card). To win, I need 10 VP, so I need 6 more points.

My key observations:
1. I should focus on either Largest Army (2 VP) or upgrading settlements to cities (settlements at nodes 6 and 13 are high-priority)
2. Buying a development card advances me toward Largest Army and potentially provides utility
3. A city upgrade would require 3 Ore and 2 Wheat - I'm not close to this yet
4. Red has many resources and might be planning a significant move

<plan>
1. Buy development cards to pursue Largest Army (need 1 more knight)
2. Use my Ore port strategically when I have excess Ore
3. Work toward upgrading my settlement at node 6 to a city (high production value)
4. Watch Red's moves carefully - they have many resources and could make a big play
5. Use my two Wood to build roads for expansion after securing Largest Army or a city upgrade
</plan>

Given these considerations, buying a development card is my best option. It has good odds of giving me a knight for Largest Army, could provide another VP directly, reduces my vulnerability to the robber, and maintains flexibility in my strategy.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 26 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Buy development cards to pursue Largest Army (need 1 more knight)
2. Use my Ore port strategically when I have excess Ore
3. Work toward upgrading my settlement at node 6 to a city (high production value)
4. Watch Red's moves carefully - they have many resources and could make a big play
5. Use my two Wood to build roads for expansion after securing Largest Army or a city upgrade
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.
  To adjust your plan, provide a NEW PLAN in your reasoning with <plan>your new plan</plan>

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and my options carefully:

## Current Game State
- I (BLUE) have 3/10 VP (3 settlements + 1 hidden victory point = 4 actual VP)
- RED has 3/10 VP (1 settlement + 1 city)
- I have 2 Wood and 1 Ore resources
- I have a Knight card and a Victory Point card
- I've already played 2 Knights
- The robber is on a Wheat hex (2,-1,-1) with value 8 (high productivity)

## Available Actions
0. Play Knight card - Move the robber and steal a resource
1. Roll the dice

## Strategic Considerations:

1. **Resource Position**: With only 2 Wood and 1 Ore, I can't build anything immediately. I need to roll to acquire more resources.

2. **Knight Card Value**: 
   - I have 2 Knights played already. Playing a 3rd would give me Largest Army (2 VP).
   - Moving the robber could protect my high-value hexes or disrupt RED's production.
   - I could potentially steal a useful resource from RED.

3. **Risk Assessment**:
   - If I roll first, I might get a 7, forcing me to discard if I have >7 cards (not a concern now).
   - If I roll productively, I'd gain more resources to enable building.
   - The Knight can be played after rolling if needed.

4. **Current Board Situation**:
   - The robber is already on a productive Wheat hex (8), which might be hindering my wheat production at node 6.
   - RED has 5 hidden resources - playing the Knight would let me steal one.
   - RED has 3 VP showing, but could have hidden VP cards.

## Decision Logic:
Playing the Knight now would give me immediate benefits:
- I would gain Largest Army (2 VP), increasing my total to 5 VP
- I can reposition the robber to hinder RED's production
- I can steal a resource from RED, potentially getting something valuable

While rolling could get me more resources, the guaranteed 2 VP from Largest Army is too valuable to delay. This is a critical strategic move that immediately advances my position.

<plan>
1. Play Knight to secure Largest Army (2 VP)
2. Move robber to RED's high-value hex (likely 🐑8 or 🧱6)
3. Next, focus on city upgrade at node 6 (with high production)
4. Work toward potential longest road by extending from my settlements
</plan>

The optimal choice is to play the Knight card:

# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to place the robber optimally to disrupt RED player while advancing my position. Let me analyze the options:

## Current Game State
- I (BLUE) have 5 VP: 3 settlements (3 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 1 hidden victory point = 6 VP total
- RED has 3 VP: 1 settlement (1 VP) + 1 city (2 VP)
- RED has 5 hidden resource cards
- I have 2 wood and 1 ore - limited resources currently

## RED's Production
Looking at RED's settlements/cities:
- 🏙️ at node 9: Produces 🐑8[⭐⭐⭐], 🌾4[⭐], 🌲10[⭐]
- 🏠 at node 20: Produces ⛏️3[⭐], 🧱6[⭐⭐⭐], 🧱9[⭐⭐]

The most valuable hexes for RED are:
- 🐑8 (high probability sheep) at (1, -1, 0) - option [1]
- 🧱6 (high probability brick) at (1, 0, -1) - option [6]

## Strategic Considerations
1. Stopping RED's expansion: RED has strong brick production, which could help them build more roads and settlements. Blocking brick would be strategic.
2. My resource needs: I need more resources overall, especially wheat for city upgrades.
3. Steal potential: I want to steal a resource RED likely has.

## Best Robber Placement Options

Option [6]: Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED
- This blocks RED's 🧱6 hex (brick with high probability)
- RED's settlement at node 20 depends heavily on brick production
- Brick is crucial for expansion (roads and settlements)
- This would significantly hamper RED's building abilities

Option [1]: Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED
- This blocks RED's 🐑8 hex (sheep with high probability)
- RED's city at node 9 gets triple production from this hex
- Blocking this reduces their sheep income significantly

<plan>
1. Continue with Largest Army strategy (already secured with 3 knights)
2. Block RED's brick production by placing robber on 🧱6 hex
3. Next turn, focus on city upgrade at node 6 (need more wheat and ore)
4. Consider roads to strongest remaining settlement locations
</plan>

After analyzing the options, I believe option [6] is optimal because:
1. It blocks RED's critical brick resource (6 is high probability)
2. Brick is essential for RED's expansion strategy
3. This directly impacts RED's ability to build new roads and settlements
4. It gives me the opportunity to steal a resource, likely brick

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Analyzing Robber Placement Options

I need to make a strategic decision about where to place the robber to maximize my advantage while hindering my opponent's progress. Let me analyze the game state and available options:

## Current Game State
- I'm BLUE with 5 VP (3 settlements, largest army bonus, 1 hidden VP card)
- RED has 4 VP (2 settlements, 1 city)
- RED currently has 7 cards, which is the threshold for losing cards to the robber
- The robber is currently on (1, 0, -1), which is a 🧱6 hex

## Key Considerations
1. I should target high-probability number hexes (6s and 8s) that benefit RED
2. I should prioritize resources RED needs for their likely next build
3. I need to consider which resource I want to steal from RED

## Analyzing RED's Production and Strategy
Looking at RED's buildings:
- RED has a city at node 9: produces 🐑8, 🌾4, 🌲10
- RED has settlements at node 20: produces ⛏️3, 🧱6, 🧱9
- RED has a settlement at node 5: produces 🌾10, 🌲9, ⛏️3

RED has strong brick production (which is currently blocked by the robber) and decent wood production. RED might be pursuing a road-building strategy.

## Evaluating High-Impact Targets
Most impactful hexes for RED:
- 🐑8 (1, -1, 0): High probability and produces for RED's city
- 🌾8 (2, -1, -1): High probability but doesn't appear to produce for RED
- 🧱6 (1, 0, -1): Currently blocked by robber
- 🌲10 (1, -2, 1): Produces for RED's city

## Best Robber Placement Options
1. Option [1] - Move to 🐑8 (1, -1, 0): This is a high-probability hex that produces for RED's city. Blocking this would significantly reduce RED's sheep production.

2. Option [7] - Move to 🌲10 (1, -2, 1): This would cut off RED's wood production from their city, limiting their ability to build roads and settlements.

3. Option [4] - Move to 🌲9 (-1, 1, 0): This produces for RED's settlement and has a decent probability.

## Final Decision
The 🐑8 hex is clearly the highest-value target, as it's a high-probability (8) resource that produces for RED's city. This would significantly impact RED's production capacity while allowing me to steal a resource.

<plan>
1. Block RED's sheep production by placing robber on 🐑8 hex
2. Continue pursuing largest army strategy (already secured with 3 knights)
3. Work toward upgrading settlement at node 6 to city (need more wheat and ore)
4. Consider expanding roads toward potential 4th settlement location
</plan>

# Analyzing Game State and Options

Let me analyze my current position and options for this turn:

## My Current Status
- I have 5 Victory Points (3 settlements, 2 for largest army)
- I have 1 hidden Victory Point card (making my real total 6 VP)
- Resources: 2 Wood, 1 Sheep, 3 Wheat, 1 Ore
- I have the Largest Army bonus (3 knights played)

## RED's Status
- 4 Victory Points (2 settlements, 1 city)
- 6 hidden cards
- No development cards

## Available Actions
0. End turn
1. Buy a development card (cost: 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore)

## Decision Analysis

I have the exact resources needed to buy a development card (1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore). If I purchase a development card:

- Best case: I draw another Victory Point card, putting me at 7 VP total (only 3 away from winning)
- Medium case: I draw a Knight, which strengthens my Largest Army lead (protection against RED)
- Other cases: I draw Monopoly, Road Building or Year of Plenty, which can help accelerate my strategy later

If I end my turn, I'll keep my current resources. My settlement at node 6 produces from high-probability hexes (6 and 8), so I should expect good resource income in the future. These resources could potentially be saved toward a city upgrade (which costs 3 Ore + 2 Wheat).

Currently, I need:
- For city upgrade: Need 2 more Ore (have 1, need 3)
- For new settlement: Need 1 Brick (have none)

<plan>
1. Buy a development card now to potentially get closer to victory
2. Focus on collecting ore to upgrade settlement at node 6 to a city 
3. Maintain Largest Army advantage
4. Consider expanding toward a fourth settlement location when resources allow
</plan>

The development card is the only build option available, and it's a strong move that aligns with my strategy. Drawing a Victory Point card would be exceptional value, while other cards would still provide strategic options.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

RESPONSE:
# Analyzing Game State and Available Actions

Let me carefully assess the current game state to determine the optimal action:

## Game Position Analysis
- I'm at 5 VP (3 settlements, Largest Army bonus)
- Red has 4 VP (2 settlements, 1 city)
- I have a hidden Victory Point card, so my actual VP count is 6/10
- Resources: 2 Wood, 2 Wheat, 1 Ore
- I have a Knight development card that I could play

## Options Analysis

**Option 0: Play Knight Card**
- Benefits:
  - Can move the robber away from the sheep hex (1,-1,0) which could be producing for me
  - Can steal a resource from Red (who has 6 cards)
  - Extends my Largest Army lead (3→4 knights)
  - Protects my knight advantage which gives me 2 VP

**Option 1: Roll Dice**
- Benefits:
  - Could gain more resources to build
  - Natural game progression

## Strategic Considerations
- My settlements produce on 3, 5, 6, 8, and 11
- The robber is currently on a sheep hex (8), which blocks my high-producing settlement at node 6
- Red has 6 cards, potentially including resources I need
- Playing the knight now maintains my strategic control

<plan>
1. Play Knight card now to move robber off my valuable 8 sheep production
2. Try to steal ore from Red if possible
3. Focus on collecting ore to upgrade settlement at node 6 to a city
4. Maintain Largest Army advantage
5. Work toward settlement expansion when resources allow
</plan>

Playing the Knight card is the optimal move because:
1. It removes the robber from my valuable 8-producing sheep hex
2. I can steal a resource from Red, potentially getting ore which I need
3. It further secures my Largest Army bonus
4. At 6 VP (including my hidden VP card), securing my advantages is crucial

# Game Analysis for Robber Placement

I need to analyze where to place the robber to maximize my advantage while hindering my opponent's progress.

## Current Game State Assessment
- I (BLUE) have 5/10 VP (3 settlements + Largest Army bonus)
- RED has 4/10 VP (2 settlements + 1 city)
- The robber is currently on (1, -1, 0) which is a Sheep hex with value 8
- This hex is actually very valuable to me as my settlement at node 6 produces from this hex

## Robber Placement Strategy
I should prioritize:
1. Moving the robber OFF my valuable 8-sheep production
2. Placing it on a high-value hex that RED depends on
3. Being able to steal a resource from RED (preferably ore)

## Analyzing RED's Production
RED has:
- A city at node 9: produces from 🐑8, 🌾4, 🌲10 
- A settlement at node 20: produces from ⛏️3, 🧱6, 🧱9
- A settlement at node 5: produces from 🌾10, 🌲9, ⛏️3

The high-value hexes for RED are:
- 🧱6 (on node 20) - brick with probability 5/36
- 🧱9 (on node 20) - brick with probability 4/36
- 🌲10 (on node 9) - wood with probability 3/36
- 🌾10 (on node 5) - wheat with probability 3/36

## Optimal Placement Options
Looking at the options where I can steal from RED:

- Option 0: (0, 0, 0) 🌾10 - This hits RED's wheat production at node 5
- Option 1: (0, -1, 1) 🌾4 - This hits RED's city at node 9, but low value (4)
- Option 5: (1, 0, -1) 🧱6 - This hits RED's brick production at node 20 (high value 6)
- Option 7: (1, -2, 1) 🌲10 - This hits RED's city at node 9 (high value 10)
- Option 15: (1, 1, -2) 🧱9 - This hits RED's brick production at node 20 (high value 9)

Option 5 (brick-6) and Option 15 (brick-9) would limit RED's road expansion capability since brick is essential for roads.

Option 7 (wood-10) affects RED's city, which doubles production.

<plan>
1. Move robber to (1, 0, -1) brick-6 hex to block RED's brick production
2. Continue saving for city upgrade at node 6
3. Maintain Largest Army advantage
4. Work toward settlement expansion after city upgrade
</plan>

After careful analysis, I should place the robber on the brick-6 hex to hamper RED's expansion capability while possibly stealing a valuable resource. This is optimal because:
1. It moves the robber off my valuable sheep-8 production
2. It targets a high-probability hex (brick-6) that RED needs for expansion
3. It gives me a chance to steal from RED
4. Brick is crucial for road building, which directly affects expansion

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and available actions to make the optimal decision:

## Current Position
- I have 5 VP (3 settlements + 2 from Largest Army)
- I have 1 hidden VP card, so effectively I'm at 6 VP
- Opponent RED has 4 VP (2 settlements + 1 city)
- I have resources: 2 wood, 3 wheat, 2 ore
- The robber is already on the brick-6 hex (1, 0, -1), blocking RED's brick production

## Strategic Assessment

My current plan was:
1. Move robber to (1, 0, -1) brick-6 hex - this is already done
2. Continue saving for city upgrade at node 6
3. Maintain Largest Army advantage
4. Work toward settlement expansion after city upgrade

For a city upgrade, I need 3 ore + 2 wheat. I currently have 2 ore and 3 wheat, so I'm only short 1 ore.

My available actions are limited:
- End my turn [0]
- Trade using my 2:1 ore port for various resources [1-4]

Trading now doesn't make sense because:
1. I have a 2:1 ore port, but trading away my ore would set me back from my city goal
2. I don't need any other resources urgently
3. None of the trades help me get the ore I need for a city

The optimal course is to end my turn and continue collecting resources. One more ore and I can upgrade to a city, bringing me to 7 VP (counting my hidden VP card).

<plan>
1. End turn and collect more resources
2. Build city at node 6 (high production settlement) once I get one more ore
3. Maintain Largest Army advantage (already have 4 knights)
4. After city upgrade, focus on another settlement or development card
5. Continue to use robber strategically against RED
</plan>

# Game Analysis for Turn 34

Let me analyze the current state of the game and my available options to make the optimal move.

## Current Game State
- I have 5 VP (3 settlements + largest army bonus of 2 VP)
- RED has 4 VP (2 settlements + 1 city)
- I have 3 wood, 3 wheat, and 3 ore in my hand
- I have 1 hidden victory point from a development card
- The robber is currently on a brick hex (1,0,-1) with a value of 6

## Available Options Analysis

**Option 0: End Turn**
- This would mean passing up opportunities to improve my position
- I have enough resources to build, so this isn't optimal

**Options 1, 2, 3: Upgrade Settlement to City**
- All require 2 wheat + 3 ore
- I have exactly 3 wheat and 3 ore, so I can upgrade one settlement
- Evaluating locations:
  - Node 6: Produces sheep(8), brick(6), wheat(8) - three high-value hexes
  - Node 13: Produces wood(3), ore(11), ore(5) - one high, one medium, one low value
  - Node 33: Produces only ore(11) - just one resource, though high value

**Options 4-7: Maritime Trades**
- These don't make sense as I don't need additional resources at this moment

## Strategic Considerations

1. **Point Projection**: 
   - Current: 5 VP + 1 hidden VP = 6 VP
   - After city upgrade: 6 VP + 1 hidden VP = 7 VP
   - RED: 4 VP (unknown hidden cards)
   
2. **Resource Production Analysis**:
   - Node 6 produces from three valuable hexes (8,6,8)
   - Doubling this production would significantly increase my resource generation
   - This is clearly my best settlement in terms of production potential

3. **Path to Victory**:
   - I'm ahead on points (especially with my hidden VP)
   - A city upgrade would put me at 7 VP
   - From there, I need 3 more VP - could be through another city and a settlement, or development cards

<plan>
1. Upgrade settlement at node 6 to a city (strong production)
2. Maintain Largest Army advantage
3. With improved wheat/sheep/brick production, aim for another settlement at a strategic location
4. Consider buying more development cards for potential VPs or knights
5. Continue using robber strategically against RED
</plan>

Based on my analysis, upgrading my settlement at node 6 to a city is clearly the best move. This settlement produces from three high-value hexes (8,8,6), and doubling this production will significantly boost my resource generation each turn. This gives me the best return on investment and accelerates my path to victory.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Turn 38

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 6 visible VP (2 settlements, 1 city, Largest Army bonus) plus 1 hidden VP card = 7 VP total
- RED has 4 VP (2 settlements, 1 city)
- I need 3 more VP to win
- Resources: 2 🌲WOOD, 2 🧱BRICK, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE

## Strategic Evaluation
My current plan focuses on upgrading settlement at node 6 to a city, but I don't currently have enough resources (need 2 more ORE and 1 more WHEAT). I should reassess my immediate options.

### Road Building Options Analysis:
1. Road at (13, 14): Extends toward ORE port but doesn't immediately enable a settlement
2. Road at (23, 52): Extends toward WOOD port which could help with future expansion
3. Road at (32, 33): Makes no strategic sense (already have settlement at 33)
4. Road at (12, 13): Makes no strategic sense (already have settlement at 13)
5. Road at (34, 35): Extends toward SHEEP port which could be valuable
6. Road at (22, 23): Limited strategic value
7. Road at (6, 7): Extends from my best city toward SHEEP hex
8. Road at (1, 6): Limited strategic value

### Possible Settlement Locations After Road Building:
- Road option 2 (23, 52) could eventually lead to node 52 for a WOOD port settlement
- Road option 5 (34, 35) could eventually lead to node 35/36 for a SHEEP port settlement
- Road option 7 (6, 7) could eventually reach node 7/8, accessing more SHEEP production

### Strategic Direction:
Since I don't have enough resources to upgrade to a city, and can't build a settlement without first building roads, I should consider:
1. Whether to build a road at all this turn
2. If yes, which road provides the best strategic advantage

## Decision Making
With 7 total VP, I'm 3 away from winning. I need to find the most efficient path.

Currently, I should focus on road building that:
1. Sets up future settlements with good resource production
2. Positions me for claiming Longest Road (2 VP) as a backup plan
3. Enables access to ports that compensate for my resource weaknesses

Looking at my production, I have good SHEEP, BRICK, and WHEAT from my city at node 6, but weaker ORE production. Extending from my city at node 6 makes the most sense to leverage my strongest production tile.

The road at (6, 7) allows me to expand toward nodes 7/8 which would give additional SHEEP (5 & 8) and WOOD (10) production. This complements my resources well and sets me on a path toward potential settlement spots.

<plan>
1. Build road at edge (6, 7) to expand from my productive city
2. Next turns: Continue expansion toward node 7/8 for a settlement that adds SHEEP and WOOD production
3. Continue collecting resources for city upgrade
4. Consider further development cards if resource production allows
5. Work toward longest road (currently 2, need more roads)
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I will build a road at edge (6, 7).

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current board position and my available options step by step.

## Current Situation:
- **My victory points**: 6/10 (2 settlements, 1 city, largest army bonus, 1 hidden VP card)
- **Opponent's victory points**: 4/10 (2 settlements, 1 city)
- **My resources**: 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 wheat, 1 ore
- **Available action**: Build a road using wood and brick

## Territory Analysis:
I have 3 buildings:
- A city at node 6 (producing sheep, brick, wheat on 8,6,8 - all excellent numbers)
- A settlement at node 13 (producing wood, ore on 3,11,5 - moderate)
- A settlement at node 33 (producing ore on 11 - good)

## Strategic Options:
I have exactly the resources needed to build one road (1 wood, 1 brick). Let's evaluate each road option:

1. **Road at (13, 14)**: Extends from my settlement toward ore/sheep hexes
2. **Road at (23, 52)**: Extends toward the wood 2:1 port
3. **Road at (32, 33)**: This seems redundant as I already have access to node 33
4. **Road at (12, 13)**: Seems redundant as I already have a settlement at 13
5. **Road at (34, 35)**: Extends toward the sheep 2:1 port
6. **Road at (22, 23)**: Extends toward the center from my other road
7. **Road at (1, 6)**: Connects from my city toward central wheat hex
8. **Road at (7, 24)**: Extends toward sheep hex on the edge
9. **Road at (7, 8)**: Extends toward a sheep node with good numbers

## Evaluating Each Option:
- Options 3 and 4 can be eliminated as they don't provide new expansion opportunities
- Option 5 (34, 35) leads toward sheep port, but I already produce good sheep at my city
- Options 1, 7, 8, 9 all extend my territory in different directions

The most promising options seem to be:
- Option 9 (7, 8): This continues my road from my productive city toward node 8, which connects to a 5-sheep hex and a 10-wood hex
- Option 8 (7, 24): This extends toward a node connected to the sheep-5 hex
- Option 2 (23, 52): This extends toward a wood 2:1 port, which could be valuable

## Future Building Potential:
Looking at potential settlement locations accessible from these roads:
- Road (7, 8) could lead to settlement at node 8 - connected to sheep-5 and wood-10 hexes
- Road (7, 24) could lead to settlement at node 24 - connected to sheep-5 hex
- Road (23, 52) leads toward a wood port, but requires additional roads before a settlement

<plan>
1. Build road at edge (7, 8) to expand toward productive sheep/wood resources
2. Next turns: Build settlement at node 8 to gain access to sheep-5 and wood-10 production
3. Continue collecting resources for city upgrade at node 13
4. Use the ore port to efficiently convert excess ore 
5. Continue building toward longest road
</plan>

Option 9 offers the best immediate path to a valuable settlement location at node 8, which would give me access to both sheep and wood resources with good probability numbers. This aligns with my goal of expanding my resource production variety before focusing on more cities.

Therefore, my optimal choice is:

\boxed{9}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 40 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build road at edge (7, 8) to expand toward productive sheep/wood resources
2. Next turns: Build settlement at node 8 to gain access to sheep-5 and wood-10 production
3. Continue collecting resources for city upgrade at node 13
4. Use the ore port to efficiently convert excess ore 
5. Continue building toward longest road
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Analyzing Robber Placement Options

I need to strategically place the robber to maximize my advantage while hindering my opponent who has 7 hidden resource cards.

## Step 1: Evaluate high-impact hexes for RED player
- RED has settlements/cities at nodes 9, 20, and 5
- RED gets resources from:
  - 🐑8 (1,-1,0) - High value (⭐⭐⭐) at node 9 (city)
  - 🌾4 (0,-1,1) - Low value (⭐) at node 9
  - 🌲10 (1,-2,1) - Low value (⭐) at node 9
  - ⛏️3 (0,1,-1) - Low value (⭐) at nodes 20 and 5
  - 🧱6 (1,0,-1) - High value (⭐⭐⭐) at node 20
  - 🧱9 (1,1,-2) - Medium value (⭐⭐) at node 20
  - 🌾10 (0,0,0) - Low value (⭐) at node 5
  - 🌲9 (-1,1,0) - Medium value (⭐⭐) at node 5

## Step 2: Consider my current resource needs
I only have 1 wheat and 1 ore. My plan involves:
- Building a road (1 brick, 1 wood)
- Eventually building a settlement (1 brick, 1 wood, 1 wheat, 1 sheep)
- City upgrade (3 ore, 2 wheat)

## Step 3: Evaluate target hexes
Best options for blocking RED while helping myself:
- Option 1: 🐑8 (1,-1,0) - Blocks RED's high-value sheep production from city, can steal from RED
- Option 6: 🧱6 (1,0,-1) - Blocks RED's high-value brick production, can steal from RED
- Option 4: 🌲9 (-1,1,0) - Blocks RED's medium wood production, can steal from RED

## Step 4: Consider the risk to my own production
- The robber is currently on 🌾8 (2,-1,-1), which doesn't affect me much
- I should avoid placing on 🐑8/🧱6/🌾8 hexes that my city at node 6 produces

## Final Decision
Option 6 (hex 🧱6) is optimal because:
1. It blocks RED's high-value brick production (⭐⭐⭐)
2. Brick is crucial for RED's road-building
3. It also blocks another resource (⭐⭐) for RED
4. I can steal a resource from RED, potentially getting brick I need
5. It doesn't block any of my own high-value production

<plan>
1. Move robber to brick-6 hex to block RED's high-value brick production
2. Continue with road at edge (7,8) when I collect the necessary resources
3. Build settlement at node 8 to gain access to sheep-5 and wood-10
4. Continue collecting resources for city upgrade at node 13
5. Use ore port efficiently and maintain largest army advantage
6. Build toward longest road when possible
</plan>

# Game Analysis

Let me carefully analyze the current game state and my available options.

## Current Game State Summary
- I have 6 VP (2 settlements + 1 city + 2 VP for largest army + 1 hidden VP card)
- My resources: 2 wheat, 3 ore
- Red has 4 VP (2 settlements + 1 city)
- The robber is on a brick-6 hex (1, 0, -1) which impacts Red's production
- I have the largest army with 4 knights played

## Available Actions Analysis
1. **End Turn** - This wastes my opportunity to build with my current resources
2. **Upgrade Settlement at node 13** - Costs 2 wheat, 3 ore (exactly what I have)
3. **Upgrade Settlement at node 33** - Costs 2 wheat, 3 ore (exactly what I have)
4. **Maritime Trades** - I don't have extra resources to trade

## Decision Analysis

Let me evaluate which settlement to upgrade to a city:

**Node 13 produces**:
- Wood-3 (low value)
- Ore-11 (low value)
- Ore-5 (medium value)
  
**Node 33 produces**:
- Ore-11 (low value)

Upgrading node 13 is clearly superior as it produces from 3 hexes instead of just 1. This would double my production on three different resource tiles rather than just one.

By upgrading node 13 to a city, I'll increase my VP count to 7 (just 3 VP away from victory). This also increases my ore production, which is crucial for development cards and more city upgrades.

<plan>
1. Upgrade settlement at node 13 to a city to reach 7 VP
2. Continue collecting resources for another city upgrade at node 33
3. Build toward node 8 to gain access to sheep-5 and wood-10
4. Maintain largest army advantage
5. Pursue longest road or development cards for final victory points
</plan>

After careful consideration, the best action is to upgrade my settlement at node 13 to a city.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section

# Game State Analysis

Let me carefully analyze the current game state and my available options.

## My Current Position:
- 7/10 VP: 2 cities (4 VP), 1 settlement (1 VP), largest army (2 VP)
- Resources: 4 Wood, 2 Sheep, 2 Wheat
- 1 hidden Victory Point card

## RED's Position:
- 6/10 VP: 1 city (2 VP), 2 settlements (2 VP), longest road (2 VP)
- Only 2 hidden resources

## Strategic Assessment:
I'm ahead by 1 VP, with RED having 6 VP. I need 3 more VP to win, and I already have 1 hidden VP from a development card. This means I only need 2 more visible VP to secure victory.

My optimal paths to victory are:
1. Upgrade my settlement at node 33 to a city (+1 VP)
2. Build a new settlement (+1 VP)
3. Buy a development card hoping for a VP card

Looking at my resources (4 Wood, 2 Sheep, 2 Wheat), I don't have any Ore which is critical for city upgrades (3 Ore + 2 Wheat) or development cards (1 Ore + 1 Sheep + 1 Wheat). I also lack Brick which would be needed for settlement expansion.

## Available Actions Review:
[0] End turn
[1-4] Maritime trades giving away Wood (which I have 4 of) for other resources

## Decision Analysis:
Since I need Ore the most right now to progress toward my city upgrade goal, and I have an Ore port (2:1) at nodes 32-33, I should consider trading for Ore. However, the available actions only show 4:1 trading ratios, suggesting I don't have roads connecting to my Ore port yet, despite having a settlement at node 33.

Trading 4 Wood for 1 Ore would allow me to start accumulating resources for a city upgrade, which costs 3 Ore + 2 Wheat total. I already have 2 Wheat, so after this trade I would just need 2 more Ore.

<plan>
1. Trade 4 Wood for 1 Ore now
2. Continue collecting resources (particularly Ore) to upgrade settlement at node 33 to a city
3. Use my hidden victory point card at the right moment
4. Maintain largest army advantage
5. Build toward promising expansion locations if resources allow
</plan>

Option 2 (Trade 4 Wood for 1 Ore) is the most strategic choice to advance toward my victory condition.

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan - Turn 48

Let me carefully analyze the current game state and my available options:

## Current Situation Assessment
- I (BLUE) have 7/10 victory points:
  * 2 Cities (4 VP)
  * 1 Settlement (1 VP)
  * Largest Army bonus (2 VP)
  * 1 hidden Victory Point card (1 VP)
- RED has 6/10 victory points
- My resources: 2 🐑SHEEP, 2 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE
- Available actions: End turn [0] or Buy development card [1]

## Option Analysis

**Option 1: Buy a development card (1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE)**
- This would use all my current resources
- Potential benefits:
  * Could get another Victory Point card (immediate progress toward winning)
  * Could get a Knight (strengthening my Largest Army advantage)
  * Could get a utility card (Monopoly, Road Building, Year of Plenty) to help next turn
- The bank has 19 development cards remaining, so odds are still reasonable

**Option 0: End Turn**
- Save my resources for future turns
- Wait for more resources to potentially upgrade my settlement to a city
- This would leave me vulnerable to robber/knight attacks while holding cards

## Strategic Considerations

1. I'm at 7 VP (plus 1 hidden) = 8 VP total, only needing 2 more to win
2. RED is at 6 VP and has Longest Road
3. Upgrading my settlement to a city would give me 9 VP (but I need 3 ore and 2 wheat, and I only have 1 ore, 2 wheat)
4. Drawing another Victory Point card would put me at 9 VP
5. I have an ore port, so trading 4 wood (which I don't have) for 1 ore isn't an option now

Looking at the risk-reward: If I buy a development card, I have a chance of getting closer to victory immediately (VP card) or strengthening my position (Knight). Ending my turn doesn't advance my position and leaves me vulnerable to resource theft.

<plan>
1. Buy development card this turn, hoping for VP card or Knight
2. If I get a VP card, I'll be at 9 VP and need just 1 more
3. Next turn focus on gathering ore/wheat for city upgrade
4. Maintain largest army advantage
5. Keep securing high-probability resource hexes with robber placement
</plan>

Given my winning position and need to press my advantage, the optimal choice is to buy a development card.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to analyze the optimal robber placement to maximize my chances of winning. Let me think through each consideration systematically:

## Current Game State
- I (BLUE) have 7 VP (2 cities, 1 settlement, largest army)
- RED has 6 VP (1 city, 2 settlements, longest road)
- I have 1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 3 ORE
- RED has 2 unknown resource cards

## Robber Placement Objectives
1. Disrupt RED's highest-value resource production
2. Target resources that RED needs most for their likely next strategy
3. Choose a hex where I can steal a useful resource
4. Protect my own critical production

## Critical Analysis of RED's Position
RED is likely to pursue one of these strategies:
- Build a city (needs 3 ORE, 2 WHEAT)
- Build a settlement (needs BRICK, WOOD, SHEEP, WHEAT)
- Buy a development card (needs ORE, SHEEP, WHEAT)

Looking at RED's buildings:
- RED's city at node 9 produces SHEEP(8★★★), WHEAT(4★), WOOD(10★)
- RED's settlement at node 20 produces ORE(3★), BRICK(6★★★), BRICK(9★★)
- RED's settlement at node 5 produces WHEAT(10★), WOOD(9★★), ORE(3★)

RED has strong BRICK production (two 6/9 hexes) and good WOOD production.

## Best Robber Placement Options

Looking at the high-value options:

[1] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) - SHEEP(8) - This blocks RED's city at node 9, disrupting a high-probability sheep hex
[7] Move robber to (1, -2, 1) - WOOD(10) - This also affects RED's city at node 9
[2] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) - WHEAT(4) - This affects RED's city at node 9
[4] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) - WOOD(9) - This affects RED's settlement at node 5
[0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) - WHEAT(10) - This affects RED's settlement at node 5
[5] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) - ORE(3) - This affects both RED settlements at nodes 5 and 20

Since RED already has the longest road and likely wants to build cities or development cards next, blocking their ORE or WHEAT production would be most effective. The SHEEP(8) hex is valuable but less critical for RED's path to victory compared to ORE or WHEAT.

Option [5] stands out because:
1. It blocks ORE(3) which affects TWO of RED's settlements
2. ORE is critical for city upgrades and development cards
3. This hampers RED's ability to buy development cards to challenge my largest army

<plan>
1. Block RED's ORE production with robber to delay their city upgrades
2. Use my current resources (especially 3 ORE) to buy a development card next
3. Build a road to prepare for next settlement near a 2:1 port
4. Focus on upgrading my settlement to a city when I have resources
5. Maintain largest army advantage while working toward 10 VP
</plan>

I'll choose option [5] to move the robber to the ORE(3) hex and steal from RED, as this affects two of RED's settlements and blocks a critical resource for city upgrades and development cards.

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 50 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Block RED's ORE production with robber to delay their city upgrades
2. Use my current resources (especially 3 ORE) to buy a development card next
3. Build a road to prepare for next settlement near a 2:1 port
4. Focus on upgrading my settlement to a city when I have resources
5. Maintain largest army advantage while working toward 10 VP

# Game Analysis

Let's carefully analyze the game state and my available options to make the optimal decision.

## Current Game Status
- I am BLUE with 7/10 victory points (2 cities = 4 VP, 1 settlement = 1 VP, largest army = 2 VP)
- I also have 2 hidden victory point cards, which means I actually have 9/10 VP!
- RED has 6/10 victory points
- I have 1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 4 ORE
- The robber is currently on tile (0, 1, -1), which produces ORE with value 3

## Available Actions
0. End my turn
1. Buy a development card (1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE)
2-5. Trade using ports (not useful as I don't have enough resources for these)

## Strategic Considerations

1. **Path to Victory**: I need just 1 more VP to win. My options are:
   - Build a settlement (need 1 brick, 1 wood, 1 sheep, 1 wheat)
   - Upgrade my settlement to a city (need 2 ore, 3 wheat)
   - Buy a development card hoping for a VP card (need 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore)

2. **Resource Analysis**: 
   - I have 4 ore, which is excellent for a city upgrade but I'm missing wheat
   - I have exactly what I need to buy a development card

3. **Development Card Probability**:
   - The dev card deck contains: VP cards, knights, monopoly, road building, and year of plenty
   - If I draw a VP card, I win immediately
   - If I draw a knight, I solidify my largest army lead
   - Any other card still has potential strategic value

## Decision-Making Process

Given that I have 9 VP (including my hidden VP cards) and need just 1 more to win, buying a development card is my best option. If I get a victory point card, I win instantly. If I get another card, I can potentially use it next turn to help secure my final point.

Ending my turn without using my resources is wasteful, especially when I'm so close to victory. Trading isn't helpful as I don't have enough resources for the trades listed.

<plan>
1. Buy a development card hoping for a VP to win
2. If not a VP, prepare to use my ORE next turn toward a city upgrade
3. Continue protecting largest army advantage
4. Win next turn by either playing a newly acquired VP card or building/upgrading with my accumulated resources
</plan>

The optimal play is to buy a development card.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds

# Game Analysis for Turn 50

Let me analyze the current game state and my options carefully:

## Current Victory Point Situation
- I (BLUE) have 7/10 VP:
  - 1 VP from 1 settlement
  - 4 VP from 2 cities
  - 2 VP from Largest Army bonus
  - 2 VP from hidden VP cards
- RED has 6/10 VP:
  - 2 VP from 2 settlements
  - 2 VP from 1 city
  - 2 VP from Longest Road bonus

## Current Resources & Options
- I have 3 ORE
- The robber is on a hex (0,1,-1) that produces ORE with value 3
- I have 1 YEAR_OF_PLENTY card (unplayed) and 2 VICTORY_POINT cards (hidden)

## Available Actions
- Option 0: End my turn (no building/trading)
- Options 1-4: Maritime trade using ports, but I don't have the required resources

## Strategic Considerations
1. I actually have 9/10 VP when counting my hidden victory point cards!
2. I need just 1 more VP to win the game
3. I have 3 ORE but can't build anything useful right now (need more resources)
4. I can't use maritime trades since they require resources I don't have
5. I already have 2 hidden VP cards which I should save for my winning move

<plan>
1. End my turn and accumulate more resources
2. Next turn, aim to either:
   - Build a settlement (if I get wood + brick + sheep + wheat)
   - Upgrade my settlement to a city (if I get 2 more ore + 3 wheat)
   - Buy a development card if I get wheat + sheep (hoping for another VP card)
3. Play all VP cards when I can reach 10 points in one move
</plan>

Since I can't build anything meaningful or make any beneficial trades with my current resources, and I'm in a strong position with 9 actual VP (including hidden VP cards), the best strategy is to end my turn and collect more resources next round.

- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 52 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. End my turn and accumulate more resources
2. Next turn, aim to either:
   - Build a settlement (if I get wood + brick + sheep + wheat)
   - Upgrade my settlement to a city (if I get 2 more ore + 3 wheat)
   - Buy a development card if I get wheat + sheep (hoping for another VP card)
3. Play all VP cards when I can reach 10 points in one move

# Game Analysis and Decision Making

Let me carefully analyze the current game state and make the optimal decision.

## Current Game State Analysis
- I have 7/10 victory points (2 cities, 1 settlement, largest army with 4 knights, 2 VP cards)
- Resources: 2 Brick, 3 Ore
- Development cards: 1 Year of Plenty, 2 Victory Point (hidden)
- Red has 6/10 points and longest road
- I need 3 more VPs to win

## Strategic Options
1. Use Year of Plenty to help build/upgrade something immediately
2. Roll dice first to see what resources I get, then decide on using Year of Plenty

## Resource Calculation for Possible Builds
- **City upgrade**: Need 3 Ore + 2 Wheat (I have 3 Ore, missing 2 Wheat)
- **Settlement**: Need 1 Brick, 1 Wood, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat (I have 2 Brick, missing Wood, Sheep, Wheat)
- **Development card**: Need 1 Ore, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat (I have 3 Ore, missing Sheep, Wheat)

## Year of Plenty Options Analysis
If I use Year of Plenty now:
- Option [1] for 2 Wheat would enable a city upgrade with my existing 3 Ore
- Option [14] for Sheep+Wheat would help toward a settlement but I'd still need Wood
- Option [12] for Wheat+Ore would help toward a city, but excess Ore isn't immediately useful

## Decision Logic
Rolling dice first is better because:
1. I might get Wheat naturally and could save Year of Plenty for other resources
2. I need to see what resources I gain before determining optimal use of Year of Plenty
3. There's a chance I could get enough resources from the roll to make a build without using Year of Plenty
4. If I don't get useful resources from the roll, I can still use Year of Plenty afterward

<plan>
1. Roll dice to see what resources I get
2. If I get 2 Wheat, upgrade a settlement to a city
3. If I get 1-2 resources toward a settlement, use Year of Plenty to complete a settlement if possible
4. If I get nothing useful, use Year of Plenty for 2 Wheat to upgrade to a city (best VP efficiency)
5. Continue gathering resources to reach 10 VP (currently at 7 VP + 2 hidden VP cards)
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I should roll the dice first rather than using Year of Plenty immediately.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position

# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to analyze where to place the robber to maximize my advantage and hinder my opponent, who is currently at 6 VP (with 2 hidden resources).

## Step 1: Evaluate the game state
- I have 7 visible VP + 2 hidden VP = 9 VP total (I'm one point away from victory)
- RED has 6 VP and holds the Longest Road bonus
- I need to protect my resource generation while disrupting RED's resource production

## Step 2: Review RED's settlements/cities
RED has:
- City at node 9: produces 🐑8[⭐⭐⭐], 🌾4[⭐], 🌲10[⭐]
- Settlement at node 20: produces ⛏️3[⭐], 🧱6[⭐⭐⭐], 🧱9[⭐⭐]
- Settlement at node 5: produces 🌾10[⭐], 🌲9[⭐⭐], ⛏️3[⭐]

## Step 3: Identify high-impact hexes for blocking
The most productive hexes for RED are:
- 🐑8 (1, -1, 0): ⭐⭐⭐ for RED's city
- 🧱6 (1, 0, -1): ⭐⭐⭐ for RED's settlement
- 🧱9 (1, 1, -2): ⭐⭐ for RED's settlement
- 🌲9 (-1, 1, 0): ⭐⭐ for RED's settlement

## Step 4: Consider my own resource needs
- I already have 3 ORE and 2 BRICK
- I need more WHEAT to upgrade my settlement to a city
- I have a Year of Plenty card I can use for WHEAT

## Step 5: Determine best robber placement
Since I need one more VP and have Development Cards that can potentially give me that VP (or resources to get it), my priority is to disrupt RED while potentially gaining a useful resource.

Looking at the options:
- Action [1]: Move to 🐑8 (1, -1, 0) - Blocks RED's highest production on their city (⭐⭐⭐)
- Action [5]: Move to 🧱6 (1, 0, -1) - Blocks RED's highest production on a settlement (⭐⭐⭐)
- Action [15]: Move to 🧱9 (1, 1, -2) - Blocks RED's secondary production (⭐⭐)

The 🐑8 hex is most valuable to RED as it provides significant production to their city. Blocking this would significantly hamper RED's resource generation while stealing a resource.

<plan>
1. Place robber on 🐑8 hex to block RED's city production
2. Use Year of Plenty for 2 WHEAT if needed
3. Build another city with my ORE + WHEAT to reach 10 VP and win
4. If that's not possible, focus on development cards for the final VP
</plan>

1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for resource diversity: Between your two settlements, secure ALL five resources if possible
- Prioritize ore and wheat for city upgrades, then wood/brick for expansion
- Place settlements at intersections of three hexes, maximizing resource production potential
- Place your two initial settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board to prevent being cut off
- Initial roads should point toward promising expansion spots or ports, not toward the center
- Evaluate each potential settlement location by considering BOTH current value AND future expansion potential
- Avoid placing initial settlements near edges that would limit your expansion options

BALANCED GROWTH STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Build 1-2 additional settlements BEFORE upgrading to cities
- Mid-game: Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and strategic development cards
- Late-game: Complete a development card path to victory OR longest road depending on game state
- Calculate resource efficiency for each build (VP gained per resources spent)
- Monitor opponents' strategies and adjust accordingly - counter their paths to victory!
- Don't over-commit to one strategy - remain flexible based on resource availability

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads with purpose - every road should lead to a valuable settlement location
- If another player is racing you to a spot, calculate if you can win the race before committing
- Create "road blocks" to cut off opponents' expansion when strategic
- Connect to valuable ports that complement your resource production - a good port can change your strategy
- Secure at least one 3:1 port early if specific 2:1 ports aren't available
- Don't waste resources on roads that don't lead to immediate settlement spots
- Focus expansion toward resource types you lack in your initial placements

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards strategically, not excessively
- Early development cards: Use only if you lack immediate expansion opportunities
- Mid-game development cards: Use to break resource monopolies or protect key hexes
- Save knight cards to protect your high-value hexes from the robber
- Use Year of Plenty to secure critical missing resources for immediate builds
- Monopoly is most effective when played immediately after a high roll for that resource
- Largest army (2 VP) requires 3+ knights - only pursue if you can maintain the lead
- Victory point cards are most valuable when kept hidden until your winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Keep your hand size below 7 cards whenever possible to avoid robber losses
- Don't trade resources that directly enable opponents to build settlements or cities
- Use ports strategically - 2:1 ports are worth 2 resource cards in efficiency
- Calculate the trade-off between immediate builds vs. saving for more valuable builds
- If resource-starved, focus on securing that resource through expansion or trades
- Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy a development card

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-producing hex of the player closest to winning
- Prioritize hexes that produce resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, target players with the resources you need most
- Move the robber away from your own high-probability hexes when possible
- Target hexes with multiple settlements/cities to maximize impact
- Consider robber placement that creates favorable trade scenarios

PATH TO VICTORY (PRIMARY):
1. Build 3-4 total settlements in strong positions 
2. Upgrade 2-3 settlements to cities (4-6 VP total)
3. Secure longest road (2 VP) OR largest army (2 VP)
4. Reach 10 VP through a combination of settlements, cities, and special cards

PATH TO VICTORY (ALTERNATIVE):
1. Focus heavily on ore/wheat production
2. Build 2 cities (4 VP) and maintain 2 settlements (2 VP)
3. Buy strategic development cards for hidden VPs and knights
4. Win with combination of cities, settlements, and largest army

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Analyze the board state, including all players' visible points and potential hidden points
2. Consider whether your move helps your victory path or hinders opponents
3. Calculate the most resource-efficient build that advances your position
4. Check if you need to protect resources from the robber or other players
5. Balance immediate gains against long-term strategic position

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 52 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Place robber on 🐑8 hex to block RED's city production
2. Use Year of Plenty for 2 WHEAT if needed
3. Build another city with my ORE + WHEAT to reach 10 VP and win
4. If that's not possible, focus on development cards for the final VP
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze my current situation:

**Victory Points (7/10):**
- 2 Cities (4 VP)
- 1 Settlement (1 VP)
- Largest Army bonus (2 VP)
- 2 Hidden VP cards

**Resources:**
- 2 BRICK
- 4 ORE
- No WHEAT, WOOD, or SHEEP

**Development Cards:**
- 1 YEAR_OF_PLENTY
- 2 VICTORY_POINT (already counted above)

## Strategic Assessment

I only need 1 more VP to reach 10 and win. My options are:
1. Build a settlement (1 VP) - Requires WOOD, BRICK, WHEAT, SHEEP
2. Upgrade settlement to city (1 VP) - Requires 3 ORE, 2 WHEAT
3. Buy a development card hoping for VP - Requires ORE, WHEAT, SHEEP

I have 4 ORE already, so my best path is to upgrade my settlement to a city, but I need 2 WHEAT.

## Action Analysis

Looking at the available actions, I can play my Year of Plenty card to get the resources I need. Option [1] allows me to take two WHEAT resources, which combined with my 4 ORE would let me build a city and win the game immediately.

The other Year of Plenty options don't create an immediate win condition. Trading via ports (actions 16-19) doesn't help me get enough WHEAT with my current resources.

<plan>
1. Play Year of Plenty card to get 2 WHEAT
2. Upgrade my settlement at node 33 to a city using 3 ORE + 2 WHEAT
3. This will give me my 8th VP, plus my 2 hidden VP cards = 10 VP for the win
</plan>

Therefore, I'll choose action [1] - Play Year of Plenty card for two WHEAT resources.

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and available actions to determine the best move.

## Current Situation
- I have 7 visible VP: 2 cities (4 VP), 1 settlement (1 VP), Largest Army bonus (2 VP)
- I have 2 hidden Victory Point development cards
- I need 10 VP to win, so I need 1 more visible VP to secure victory
- I have 2 BRICK, 2 WHEAT, 4 ORE
- Red has 6 VP (1 city, 2 settlements, Longest Road bonus)

## Available Actions
- [0] End Turn - No progress toward victory
- [1] Upgrade settlement at node 33 to city (Cost: 2 WHEAT, 3 ORE) - Gains 1 VP
- [2-5] Maritime trades - These won't directly help me win this turn

## Strategy Analysis
Looking at my resources, I have exactly what I need to upgrade my settlement at node 33 to a city:
- I have 2 WHEAT and 4 ORE
- A city upgrade costs 2 WHEAT and 3 ORE

This upgrade would give me 1 additional VP, bringing my visible VP to 8. With my 2 hidden VP cards, I would reach 10 VP total, winning the game immediately.

The maritime trade options aren't useful right now as I already have the exact resources needed for the city upgrade.

<plan>
1. Upgrade settlement at node 33 to city using 2 WHEAT + 3 ORE
