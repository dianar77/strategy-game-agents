You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with a SUPERIOR "Ore-Wheat-Cities" fast victory strategy. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to CONSISTENTLY DEFEAT the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY (MOST CRITICAL DECISION):
- TARGET NUMBERS: Prioritize settlements on 6, 8, 5, and 9 - HIGHEST PIP COUNT WINS
- RESOURCE DIVERSITY: Secure ALL five resources across your two settlements
- ORE-WHEAT FOCUS: Place at least one settlement on a strong ore hex and one on a strong wheat hex
- MAXIMIZE PROBABILITY: Place on intersections of THREE hexes to maximize resource production
- AVOID SAME RESOURCES: Never place both settlements on the same resource type
- PORTS MATTER: Consider 2:1 ports (ore/wheat) or 3:1 ports as second settlement placement
- EXPANSION PLANNING: Place settlements on OPPOSITE sides of the board for future growth
- ROADS DIRECTION: Point initial roads toward valuable future expansion spots, NEVER toward center
- NUMBER DIVERSITY: Try to have 5-6 DIFFERENT numbers across your two settlements 
- CRITICAL ANALYSIS: Before confirming placement, verify access to all resources and expansion paths

EARLY-GAME STRATEGY (FIRST 8 TURNS):
- BUILD 1 ADDITIONAL SETTLEMENT ASAP to secure a missing critical resource
- Target this third settlement at a location with ore or wheat that you lack
- After third settlement, FOCUS EXCLUSIVELY ON UPGRADING TO CITIES
- Calculate the resource ROI - cities provide DOUBLE resources for the rest of the game!
- Only build roads that lead DIRECTLY to valuable settlement locations
- Use development cards strategically when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- NEVER trade away ore or wheat unless you're receiving ore or wheat in return

MID-GAME STRATEGY (TURNS 9-15):
- CITY-FOCUSED PATH: Upgrade ALL settlements to cities as quickly as possible
- MAXIMUM PRODUCTION: Each city produces DOUBLE resources - prioritize over new settlements
- DEVELOPMENT CARDS: Buy when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore, especially after cities
- LARGEST ARMY FOCUS: Play knights strategically to reach 3+ for largest army (2 VP)
- PORTS UTILIZATION: Use 2:1 ports when available, prefer 3:1 over 4:1 trading
- BLOCKING: Consider roads that cut off opponent's expansion if minimal resource cost
- RESOURCE CALCULATION: Always calculate exact resources needed for next 1-2 builds

LATE-GAME STRATEGY (TURN 16+):
- WIN CONDITION CALCULATION: Constantly track your path to 10 VP
- HIDDEN POINTS: Purchase development cards to secure hidden VP cards
- VICTORY TIMING: Plan to reveal VP cards only when they secure your win
- OPPONENT MONITORING: Block opponent approaching 8+ visible points
- ROBBER TARGETING: Always place robber on highest-value hex of player closest to winning
- CRITICAL BUILDS: Focus only on builds that directly contribute to reaching 10 VP

DEVELOPMENT CARD MASTERY:
- BUY DEVELOPMENT CARDS when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- KNIGHT TIMING: Use knights to protect your high-value hexes from robber
- LARGEST ARMY: Aggressively pursue if you've already played 2+ knights (worth 2 VP)
- MONOPOLY STRATEGY: Play after a high probability roll for that resource (target ore/wheat)
- YEAR OF PLENTY: Use to get exact resources needed for a city upgrade
- ROAD BUILDING: Save for securing critical settlement locations or longest road
- VP CARD SECRECY: Keep your victory point cards hidden until winning turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- CITIES FIRST: Target 2-3 cities as early as possible (ore-wheat strategy)
- RESOURCE RATIO: Focus on 70% ore-wheat, 30% other resources
- HAND MANAGEMENT: Keep your hand below 7 cards to avoid robber losses
- PORT PRIORITY: Use 2:1 ports first, then 3:1, and 4:1 as last resort
- AVOID BAD TRADES: Never trade resources that directly help opponents build
- EVERY ACTION COUNTS: Always do something productive each turn

WINNING PATH (10 VP):
1. PRIMARY STRATEGY: 3 cities (6 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 1 VP card = 10 VP
2. ALTERNATIVE PATH: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards = 10 VP
3. TRACK ALL POINTS: Visible points (settlements/cities) + potential hidden points (development cards)

TURN-BY-TURN PLANNING:
1. Assess your current VP and opponents' VP (both visible and potential hidden)
2. Identify your build priority: CITIES FIRST, then strategic settlements or development cards
3. Calculate the most efficient path to required resources for your next build
4. Anticipate your next 2-3 turns and plan accordingly
5. Always make progress each turn - if you can't build, buy development cards or trade strategically

CRITICAL DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Will this move get me closer to 10 VP faster than other options?
2. Is upgrading to a city better than building a new settlement right now?
3. Should I save resources for a more valuable build next turn?
4. Will this move block my opponent's path to victory?
5. Is this the most efficient use of my limited resources?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)
