PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

RESPONSE:
# Initial Settlement Placement Analysis

I need to analyze the board carefully to find the optimal first settlement placement. I'll look for:
- High probability numbers (6 & 8), especially on ore and wheat
- Nodes that connect multiple valuable resources
- Expansion potential and strategic positioning

Let me examine the resource distribution and dice probabilities:

## Analyzing High-Value Nodes

Nodes with 6 or 8 probability hexes:
- Node 14: Connects to ⛏️6 (ore) - good for city upgrades
- Node 15: Connects to ⛏️6 (ore) and 🌾8 (wheat) - excellent for city strategy
- Node 4: Connects to ⛏️6 (ore) and 🌾8 (wheat) - excellent for city strategy
- Node 19: Connects to 🧱8 (brick) - good for early expansion
- Node 16: Connects to 🧱8 (brick) and 🌾8 (wheat) - good mix for early game
- Node 5: Connects to 🌾8 (wheat) - important for development cards and cities
- Node 12: Connects to ⛏️6 (ore) - good for city upgrades
- Node 21: Connects to 🧱8 (brick) - good for early expansion

Of these, Node 15 and Node 4 are particularly strong as they connect to both ore-6 and wheat-8, which perfectly aligns with our city-focused development card strategy. These resources are crucial for city upgrades (ore+wheat) and development cards (wheat+sheep).

## Port Access Consideration
Node 15 is closer to the 🌾 wheat port (through nodes 17→18→40), which may be valuable if we produce excess wheat.
Node 4 is closer to the ⛏️ ore port (through nodes 3→12→32/33), which could be useful if we get good ore production.

## Resource Diversity
- Node 15: ⛏️6 (ore), 🌾8 (wheat), 🐑4 (sheep) - excellent mix covering 3 resources
- Node 4: ⛏️6 (ore), 🌾8 (wheat), 🐑4 (sheep) - same excellent mix as Node 15

## Expansion Potential
Both nodes 15 and 4 have good expansion potential. From these positions, I could expand to secure additional resources in subsequent turns.

<plan>
1. Place first settlement at Node 15 connecting ore(6), wheat(8), and sheep(4)
2. For second settlement, target another high-value production node with complementary resources (wood/brick) and position for expansion
3. Focus on upgrading settlements to cities and buying development cards
4. Target 3-4 cities + largest army as primary victory path
</plan>

After careful analysis, Node 15 is the optimal choice. It provides access to the high-probability ore(6) and wheat(8) resources which are critical for my city/development card strategy, along with sheep to complete the development card resource requirements.

# Initial Road Placement Analysis

I need to place my first road to position myself for an optimal second settlement. Let me analyze each option strategically:

## Option [0] - Build at edge (4, 15)
This road would connect my settlement at node 15 to node 4. Looking at node 4's position:
- It connects to ore(6), wheat(8), and sheep(4) hexes
- While this provides good resources, it doesn't expand toward new resource types
- This direction doesn't lead to any ports directly

## Option [1] - Build at edge (15, 17)
This road would connect my settlement at node 15 to node 17. Analyzing node 17:
- It connects to wheat(8), sheep(4), and sheep(4) hexes
- This gives access to the same wheat(8) I already have, plus additional sheep production
- This direction leads toward the wheat port (nodes 40, 44) which could be valuable later
- Node 17 also provides potential expansion toward wood(3) which I don't currently have

## Option [2] - Build at edge (14, 15)
This road would connect my settlement at node 15 to node 14. Looking at node 14:
- It connects to ore(6), sheep(5), and sheep(4) hexes
- This gives access to a second sheep hex while maintaining ore production
- This direction leads toward the ore port (nodes 32, 33) which is very valuable for my development card strategy
- This path also provides future access to brick(5) which I'll need for future expansion

<plan>
1. Build first road toward the ore port for better long-term resource conversion
2. Target a second settlement with good wood/brick production to complement my strong ore/wheat position
3. Focus on cities and development cards as my primary strategy
4. Aim for 3 cities (6 VP), 2 settlements (2 VP), and largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
</plan>

After analysis, option [2] (edge 14-15) is optimal because:
1. It moves toward the valuable ore port which will support my development card strategy
2. It provides access to more diverse resources (additional sheep and potential brick access)
3. It preserves flexibility for second settlement placement
4. It positions me well for the development card path to victory

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 2 | Player: BLUE | Action: BUILD_INITIAL_SETTLEMENT

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build first road toward the ore port for better long-term resource conversion
2. Target a second settlement with good wood/brick production to complement my strong ore/wheat position
3. Focus on cities and development cards as my primary strategy
4. Aim for 3 cities (6 VP), 2 settlements (2 VP), and largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Initial Settlement Analysis

I need to place my second initial settlement, which is a crucial decision that will significantly impact my game strategy. This settlement requires no resources (it's free as part of the initial setup), and I'll also get to place a free road after choosing the settlement.

## Key Considerations:
1. Access to complementary resources to my current settlement (which produces ore 6, wheat 8, sheep 4)
2. High-probability dice numbers (6 & 8 are best)
3. Access to resources I'm currently lacking (brick and wood)
4. Potential expansion paths
5. Proximity to useful ports
6. Distance from opponent settlements

## Resource Assessment of My Current Position:
- Strong ore and wheat production (6 and 8 are excellent numbers)
- Some sheep (4 is below average)
- No wood or brick production

## Analysis of Best Options:

### Node 33 [Option 23]
- Connected to ore port (2:1)
- On hexes with ore 6 (⭐⭐⭐) and wheat 10
- Would give me strong ore production but little diversification

### Node 13 [Option 7]
- On hexes with ore 6 (⭐⭐⭐), sheep 5, and wheat 10
- Gives me more ore and adds decent sheep and wheat
- Connected to ore port through my existing settlement

### Node 29 [Option 19]
- On brick 5, brick 9, and wheat 11
- Access to brick port (2:1)
- Adds brick which I'm missing, but probability isn't great

### Node 7 [Option 2]
- On wheat 11, ore 3, and sheep 6 (⭐⭐⭐)
- Adds good sheep production and some diversity
- Not great probability numbers except sheep 6

### Node 10 [Option 5]
- On brick 5, brick 9, and wood 2
- Would give me access to both missing resources (brick and wood)
- But wood 2 is very poor production

### Node 23 [Option 13]
- On wood 11, desert (with robber), and sheep 6 (⭐⭐⭐)
- Good sheep production and wood 11 is decent
- Desert hex is non-productive

## Decision Making:

Looking at my current settlement (produces ore 6, wheat 8, sheep 4), I need to prioritize getting wood and brick resources for expansion while maintaining a balanced resource portfolio.

Node 7 (option 2) gives me good sheep 6 production plus some ore and wheat, which would strengthen my core resources but not add wood or brick that I need for expansion.

Node 29 (option 19) would give me brick and wheat, complementing my current resources nicely, though the numbers (5, 9, 11) aren't ideal.

Node 10 (option 5) would give me both brick and wood, which I'm completely lacking, despite the poor wood 2 production. Having some access to these resources is important for building roads and settlements.

Based on my development card strategy, I need to ensure I can build settlements and roads early to reach good positions, so securing brick and wood is important.

<plan>
1. Build second initial settlement at a location with wood/brick to enable expansion
2. Focus on developing toward high-value locations or ports
3. Maintain development card strategy, aiming for cities and largest army
4. Target 3 cities (6 VP), 2 settlements (2 VP), and largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
</plan>

Looking at the balance of resources and probability, I choose Node 10 to gain access to both brick and wood resources that I'm completely lacking, which will enable early expansion.

- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

# Game Analysis for Initial Road Placement

I need to carefully consider the optimal placement for my second initial road. This is a critical decision that will influence my expansion possibilities throughout the game.

## Analyzing My Current Position
- I have two settlements:
  - Settlement at node 15: produces ore (6), wheat (8), and sheep (4) - very strong production
  - Settlement at node 10: produces wood (2), brick (9), brick (5) - good brick production

- My first road is already at edge (14, 15)
- I currently have 1 wood and 2 brick resources

## Evaluating the Road Options

**Option 0: Build road at edge (9, 10)**
- Direction: This would head toward nodes 8 and 27
- Node 8 connects to: ore (3), wheat (11), brick (9)
- Node 27 connects to: wheat (11), brick (9)
- Benefits: Opens access to wheat (11) and ore (3)
- Drawbacks: Heads toward the edge of the board with fewer expansion options

**Option 1: Build road at edge (10, 11)**
- Direction: This would head toward nodes 12, 31, and 32
- Node 12 connects to: wood (2), wheat (10), ore (6)
- Node 31 connects to: brick (5)  
- Node 32 connects to: brick (5), wheat (10), ore port
- Benefits: Access to the ore port and strong ore (6) production
- Drawbacks: Requires further expansion to reach high-value nodes

**Option 2: Build road at edge (10, 29)**
- Direction: This would head toward nodes 27, 28, and 29
- Node 27 connects to: wheat (11), brick (9)
- Node 28 connects to: brick (9) and the brick port
- Node 29 connects to: brick (5), brick (9), brick port
- Benefits: Quick access to the brick port which matches my good brick production
- Drawbacks: Focuses on resources I already have good production of

## Strategic Decision-Making

Looking at my long-term development card strategy:
- I need access to ore, wheat, and sheep for development cards
- I already have good ore (6) and wheat (8) production at node 15
- For city development, I need more ore and wheat

Option 1 (edge 10, 11) provides the best strategic value:
1. It heads toward high-value ore (6) at node 12
2. It provides access to the ore port at nodes 32-33, which will be crucial for my city upgrades
3. It keeps my expansion options open in multiple directions
4. It aligns with my development card strategy by providing access to more ore

<plan>
1. Build initial road toward node 11 to open path to ore port and more ore (6) production
2. Build settlement at ore-producing locations or the ore port
3. Focus on upgrading settlements to cities (especially at node 15)
4. Continue development card strategy for hidden VPs and largest army
5. Target 3 cities (6 VP), 2 settlements (2 VP), and largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
</plan>

After careful analysis, I'll build my second initial road at edge (10, 11), which gives me better access to ore, wheat, and the ore port.

# Game State Analysis

I need to analyze my current position and available resources to make the optimal move:

**Current Resources:**
- 1 🌲 Wood
- 2 🧱 Brick
- 1 ⛏️ Ore

**Victory Points:** 2/10
**Buildings:** 2 settlements, 0 cities, 2 roads
**Production:** My settlements generate:
- Settlement at node 15: ⛏️6 (high probability), 🌾8 (high probability), 🐑4
- Settlement at node 10: 🌲2 (low probability), 🧱9, 🧱5

## Strategic Assessment

1. I have enough resources to build exactly one road (1 wood + 1 brick).
2. I need to decide which direction provides the best expansion potential.
3. Looking at my current plan, I want to build toward the ore port and/or more ore production.

## Road Building Options Analysis

Let me evaluate each road option:

**Option 1:** Edge (9, 10) - Doesn't align with my current plan, moves away from ore.

**Option 2:** Edge (13, 14) - Moves toward node 13, but this direction doesn't lead to significant ore production or the ore port.

**Option 3:** Edge (15, 17) - Moves toward sheep production but doesn't enhance ore access.

**Option 4:** Edge (11, 32) - This builds directly toward the ore port (nodes 32, 33). This aligns with my current plan to secure the ore port for efficient ore trading.

**Option 5:** Edge (11, 12) - Moves toward wheat but doesn't improve ore access.

**Option 6:** Edge (4, 15) - Moves away from ore resources.

**Option 7:** Edge (10, 29) - Moves toward the brick port, but brick is lower priority.

**Option 8:** Edge (14, 37) - Heads toward a general port, not optimal.

## Decision Logic

Option 4 (building at edge 11, 32) directly supports my current plan:
- It moves me toward the ore port (nodes 32, 33)
- This will allow me to trade ore at a 2:1 ratio
- Given my settlement at node 15 produces high-probability ore, this port will be very valuable
- This road position enables future settlement building at the ore port
- Aligns with my city-focused strategy which requires significant ore

<plan>
1. Build road toward node 32 to open path to ore port
2. Next turn, aim to build another road to reach node 32/33 (ore port)
3. Build settlement at the ore port when resources allow
4. Focus on upgrading settlements to cities (especially at node 15)
5. Continue development card strategy for hidden VPs and largest army
6. Target 3 cities (6 VP), 2 settlements (2 VP), and largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I should build a road at edge (11, 32) to advance toward the ore port, supporting my city-focused strategy.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 4 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build road toward node 32 to open path to ore port
2. Next turn, aim to build another road to reach node 32/33 (ore port)
3. Build settlement at the ore port when resources allow
4. Focus on upgrading settlements to cities (especially at node 15)
5. Continue development card strategy for hidden VPs and largest army
6. Target 3 cities (6 VP), 2 settlements (2 VP), and largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.
  To adjust your plan, provide a NEW PLAN in your reasoning with <plan>your new plan</plan>

❓ Select action by number (0-9):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the game state, resources, and available options to determine the best move for maximizing my chances of winning.

## Game State Assessment
- I have 2/10 victory points (2 settlements)
- My resources: 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 sheep, 1 ore
- My current settlements are at:
  * Node 15: Produces ore(6★★★), wheat(8★★★), sheep(4★) - excellent high-probability production
  * Node 10: Produces wood(2), brick(9★★), brick(5★★) - good brick production but weak wood

## Resource Analysis
- I have exactly 1 wood and 1 brick - just enough for a road build
- I have 1 sheep and 1 ore, so I'm still far from a development card (need 1 more wheat)
- I can't build any settlements currently (need more resources)
- I'm following a development card strategy for victory, aiming for cities + largest army

## Strategic Considerations
1. According to my current plan, I want to build toward the ore port (nodes 32, 33)
2. I already have a road to node 32, so building to node 33 would secure the ore port
3. Securing the ore port would be extremely valuable for my development card strategy, as I'll need lots of ore
4. Having port access reduces dependency on trading with opponents
5. My settlement at node 15 produces excellent ore and wheat, so the ore port complements this

## Available Road Options Analysis
- Option [4] Build a road at edge (32, 33): This directly connects to the ore port, aligned with my plan
- Other options don't advance my strategic objective of securing the ore port

<plan>
1. Build road to reach node 33 (completing access to ore port)
2. Use the ore port to efficiently trade ore when needed
3. Focus on acquiring wheat for development cards and city upgrades
4. Target upgrading my node 15 settlement to a city (high ore/wheat production)
5. Continue development card strategy for hidden VPs and largest army
6. Aim for 3 cities (6 VP), 2 settlements (2 VP), and largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
</plan>

Based on my analysis, building the road to connect node 33 and secure the ore port is clearly the best move, directly advancing my strategic plan.

RESPONSE:
# Game Analysis

Let me analyze my current position and options:

## Resources
Current resources: 1 brick, 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore
These resources allow me to either end my turn or buy a development card.

## Victory Point Analysis
- I currently have 2 VP (from 2 settlements)
- My plan targets 3 cities (6 VP), 2 settlements (2 VP), and largest army (2 VP) for a total of 10 VP
- Development cards are crucial for my strategy to obtain hidden VPs and knights for largest army

## Strategy Considerations
1. My opponent has 9 hidden cards - they may be close to making a significant move
2. I'm well-positioned with access to ore (6 - high probability) and wheat (8 - high probability)
3. I've secured access to the ore port, which is strategically valuable
4. I have the exact resources needed to buy a development card

## Development Card Benefits
- Could be a Victory Point card (immediate hidden progress)
- Could be a Knight (progress toward largest army + robber movement)
- Could be a Year of Plenty or Monopoly (valuable resource acquisition)
- Development cards are central to my declared strategy

## Decision Logic
- Buying a development card aligns with my plan focusing on development cards for hidden VPs and largest army
- All possible development card outcomes would be beneficial in some way
- I don't have enough resources to make any other builds this turn
- The sooner I start acquiring development cards, the better my chances of securing largest army

<plan>
1. Buy development card now to progress toward hidden VPs and largest army
2. Continue building roads to reach node 33 (completing access to ore port)
3. Use the ore port to efficiently trade ore when needed
4. Focus on acquiring wheat for development cards and city upgrades
5. Target upgrading my node 15 settlement to a city (high ore/wheat production)
6. Aim for 3 cities (6 VP), 2 settlements (2 VP), and largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
</plan>

My optimal action is to buy a development card, which could provide immediate hidden value and aligns perfectly with my declared strategy.

- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 8 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Buy development card now to progress toward hidden VPs and largest army
2. Continue building roads to reach node 33 (completing access to ore port)
3. Use the ore port to efficiently trade ore when needed
4. Focus on acquiring wheat for development cards and city upgrades
5. Target upgrading my node 15 settlement to a city (high ore/wheat production)
6. Aim for 3 cities (6 VP), 2 settlements (2 VP), and largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze my current position and options:

## Current Game State
- I have 2 victory points (2 settlements)
- I have only 1 brick and 1 ore in my hand
- I have 1 knight development card 
- The robber is on a desert hex (1,0,-1), so it's not blocking any production
- Red player has 8 cards, which means they're vulnerable to a 7 roll
- My key production hexes are ore 6 (⭐⭐⭐) and wheat 8 (⭐⭐⭐)

## Option Analysis

### [0] Play Knight Card
If I play the knight card now:
- Pros:
  - I could move the robber to a hex that blocks Red's production
  - I could steal one of Red's 8 cards, potentially getting a resource I need
  - I would start progress toward the Largest Army (2 VP)
- Cons:
  - I'd use my knight card now instead of saving it for when my key production hexes are blocked
  - With only 1 knight played, I'm still far from getting Largest Army
  - I wouldn't get to roll the dice and potentially collect resources

### [1] Roll the Dice
If I roll the dice:
- Pros:
  - I could collect more resources to build or buy development cards
  - I save my knight card for when it's more strategically valuable
  - I maintain my normal turn progression
- Cons:
  - If I roll a 7, I'll need to move the robber (which isn't terrible as it's not blocking anyone now)

## Decision Logic

Looking at my plan, I want to progress toward hidden VPs and largest army by buying development cards. However, I currently don't have the resources to buy a development card (need wheat, sheep, and ore). My knight card is valuable, but playing it now doesn't align with my immediate needs.

I have a strong ore (6) and wheat (8) production set up at node 15, which means a dice roll has good chances of giving me critical resources I need. Red having 8 cards means they're vulnerable to a 7 roll, which could help me disrupt their plans if I get lucky.

The robber is currently on the desert hex, which means it's not blocking anyone's production. Using my knight card now would be premature when the robber isn't hurting me.

<plan>
1. Focus on resource collection by rolling dice
2. Buy development cards when I get sheep/wheat/ore combination
3. Continue building roads toward node 33 (completing access to ore port)
4. Use the ore port to efficiently trade excess ore for needed resources
5. Target upgrading my node 15 settlement to a city (high ore/wheat production)
6. Save knight card for defensive use when my key production hexes get blocked
7. Aim for 3 cities (6 VP), 2 settlements (2 VP), and largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
</plan>

My current plan is still sound, but I need to prioritize resource collection to execute it. Rolling the dice is the optimal choice as it allows me to continue my resource gathering strategy.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current situation carefully:

**Current Resources:** 1 Brick, 2 Ore
**Development Cards:** 1 Knight card
**Victory Points:** 2/10 (from 2 settlements)
**Robber Location:** (1, 0, -1) - Currently on a desert tile, so not affecting production

## Option 0: Play Knight Card
- Benefits:
  - Can move the robber to disrupt opponent's production
  - Can steal a resource from RED player who has 9 cards
  - Will contribute toward Largest Army (2 VP)
- Considerations:
  - RED player has 9 resource cards, making them vulnerable to the robber
  - RED has strong production on node 5 (8 wheat, 8 brick)
  - Playing the knight now means I won't have it for defense if the robber is placed on my high-production hexes later

## Option 1: End Turn
- Benefits:
  - Save Knight card for defensive use later
  - No immediate gain, but preserves tactical options
- Considerations:
  - I have limited resources (1 brick, 2 ore) and can't build anything this turn
  - RED player has 9 cards and will likely make a significant play on their turn

## Strategic Evaluation

- RED player has 9 cards, which is a substantial advantage
- Robber is currently on desert, not affecting anyone's production
- My high-value production is on the ore (6) and wheat (8) hexes
- Playing the knight now would disrupt RED's resource advantage and potentially steal a useful resource
- If I don't play the knight, RED will likely build something significant on their turn

<plan>
1. Use knight cards aggressively when opponents have many resources
2. Target disrupting RED's wheat/brick production (highest probability numbers)
3. Focus on collecting ore/wheat for city upgrades and development cards
4. Continue building toward ore port while securing another settlement location
5. Aim for largest army (2 VP) + 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) = 10 VP
</plan>

Looking at RED's position, they have 9 cards and strong production. They're likely planning a significant build on their next turn (possibly a city or multiple roads/settlement). The robber isn't currently affecting anyone as it's on the desert.

Given RED's large hand size, playing the knight now would be highly strategic - I can disrupt their strongest production (node 5 with wheat 8 and brick 8) and potentially steal a resource I need. This would significantly slow their progress and give me time to gather resources for my next build.

Since RED has a significant resource advantage and the knight will contribute to largest army, playing it now is the optimal move.

- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to determine the optimal robber placement to disrupt RED player while maximizing my strategic advantage.

## Step 1: Assess RED's resource production
RED has settlements at:
- Node 5: Producing 🐑4[⭐], 🌾8[⭐⭐⭐], 🧱8[⭐⭐⭐]
- Node 3: Producing 🐑4[⭐], 🌲2, ⛏️6[⭐⭐⭐]

RED's high-probability resources are:
- 🌾 Wheat (8)
- 🧱 Brick (8)
- ⛏️ Ore (6)

## Step 2: Consider RED's hidden resources
RED has 9 hidden resource cards, which is a substantial amount. This makes them vulnerable to losing cards if the robber is rolled, and also suggests they might be planning a significant build on their turn.

## Step 3: Identify highest-value targets
The most impactful hexes to block for RED are:
- 🧱8 (0, 1, -1) - High-probability brick
- 🌾8 (-1, 1, 0) - High-probability wheat
- ⛏️6 (-1, 0, 1) - High-probability ore

## Step 4: Strategic considerations
1. RED has brick and wheat production, which enables road building and settlements
2. RED has ore production, which enables cities and development cards
3. I should prioritize blocking their most productive resources
4. I should steal a resource that helps me with my next build

## Step 5: My resource needs
I currently have 1 🧱 and 2 ⛏️. Based on my plan, I want to collect ore/wheat for city upgrades and development cards. I'm lacking wheat completely.

## Step 6: Evaluate top options
- Option 4: Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) - Blocks 🌾8, which is RED's high-value wheat hex and would significantly impair their ability to build settlements, cities, or development cards.
- Option 5: Move robber to (0, 1, -1) - Blocks 🧱8, which would hamper RED's road and settlement expansion.
- Option 3: Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) - Blocks ⛏️6, which would limit RED's city upgrades and development cards.

## Decision:
Option 4 is optimal because:
1. It blocks the 8-wheat hex, which is vital for almost all builds
2. RED likely has wheat among their 9 cards that I could steal
3. I need wheat for my city upgrades and development card strategy
4. This aligns with my plan to disrupt RED's wheat production

<plan>
1. Use knight cards aggressively when opponents have many resources
2. Continue targeting and disrupting RED's wheat production (highest probability numbers)
3. Focus on collecting ore/wheat for city upgrades and development cards
4. Work toward ore port while securing another settlement location
5. Aim for largest army (2 VP) + 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) = 10 VP
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?

# Game State Analysis

Let me carefully evaluate the current situation to make an optimal decision:

## Current Position Assessment
- I have 2 VPs (2 settlements)
- Resources: 4 Brick, 3 Ore
- Red has 3 VPs (3 settlements)
- I've already rolled and played a knight this turn, so I'm at the trading/building phase

## Resource Analysis
- My 4 brick and 3 ore aren't immediately useful without wheat or sheep
- I need wheat and sheep for:
  1. Development cards (1 ore + 1 wheat + 1 sheep)
  2. Cities (3 ore + 2 wheat)
- Current access to resources:
  - Strong ore production (node 15 with 6⭐⭐⭐)
  - Good brick production (nodes 5⭐⭐ and 9⭐⭐)
  - Strong wheat at node 15 (8⭐⭐⭐) but currently blocked by robber

## Maritime Trade Options
I can trade 4 brick for 1 of any resource. The question is whether to trade now or wait.

## Strategic Considerations
1. Red has 5 hidden cards - they may be accumulating resources for upgrades
2. I need wheat and sheep to progress my development card strategy
3. I already have an ore port at nodes 32-33, which I'm connected to
4. My current plan focuses on city upgrades and development cards

## Decision Analysis
- Trading 4 brick for 1 wheat would help toward a development card or city
- However, I still wouldn't have enough resources to build anything this turn
- The robber is blocking my best wheat production currently
- Since I can't make a productive move this turn, I should consider:
  - Holding resources for future turns when I might get the wheat/sheep I need
  - Clearing inventory before a potential 7 roll on the next turn

## Optimal Decision
Since I have 7 resources (4 brick + 3 ore), there's a risk of losing resources if a 7 is rolled. Trading down to 4 total resources reduces that risk. Given my development card strategy, wheat is the most valuable resource to acquire right now.

<plan>
1. Focus on acquiring wheat and sheep for development cards
2. Use my ore port (2:1) when I have excess ore
3. Continue targeting RED's resource production with robber placement
4. Save resources for city upgrades at my high-production node 15
5. Use development card strategy: aim for largest army (2 VP) + cities/settlements for remaining VP
</plan>

I'll trade 4 brick for 1 wheat, leaving me with 0 brick and 3 ore, reducing my risk on the next roll while positioning me closer to a development card purchase when I get sheep.

5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

RESPONSE:
# Game State Analysis

I need to analyze where to move the robber to best disrupt RED while positioning myself for victory. Let me evaluate the key factors:

## RED's Production
RED currently has 3 settlements with strong production:
- Node 5: 🐑4[⭐], 🌾8[⭐⭐⭐], 🧱8[⭐⭐⭐] - Very strong wheat/brick production
- Node 3: 🐑4[⭐], 🌲2, ⛏️6[⭐⭐⭐] - Strong ore production
- Node 21: 🧱8[⭐⭐⭐], 🌾9[⭐⭐], 🌲10[⭐] - Strong brick/decent wheat production

RED also has 6 hidden resource cards, indicating they've accumulated resources and may be close to making a significant play.

## My Strategy Context
My plan focuses on development cards and city upgrades. I need wheat, sheep, and ore for development cards, and wheat and ore for city upgrades. I already have an ore port (2:1) that gives me flexibility with ore.

## Robber Placement Options

The best options are those that:
1. Block RED's high-value production
2. Target resources I need but struggle to produce
3. Allow me to steal from RED

Looking at the high-value hexes RED uses:
- 🌾8 at (-1, 1, 0) - This is a valuable wheat hex used by RED at node 5
- 🧱8 at (0, 1, -1) - This is a valuable brick hex used by RED at nodes 5 and 21
- ⛏️6 at (-1, 0, 1) - This is a valuable ore hex used by RED at node 3

Evaluating my top options:
- Option [4] - Move to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED:
  * Blocks a high-probability wheat (8) that RED produces at node 5
  * Wheat is critical for both development cards and city upgrades
  * I only have 1 wheat currently, so disrupting RED's wheat and potentially stealing more is valuable

- Option [5] - Move to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED:
  * Blocks a high-probability brick (8) that RED produces at nodes 5 and 21
  * However, brick is less critical for my development card strategy

- Option [3] - Move to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED:
  * Blocks a high-probability ore (6) hex
  * However, I already have 2 ore and a 2:1 ore port, so this might be less impactful

## Decision

Option [4] is optimal because:
1. It blocks RED's critical wheat production on a high-probability (8) hex
2. Wheat is essential for my development card strategy
3. RED has 3 settlements compared to my 2, so hampering their resource generation is crucial
4. I'll have a chance to steal a card from RED, potentially gaining a needed resource

<plan>
1. Place robber on RED's wheat hex to disrupt their production
2. Save my ore and wheat to purchase development cards
3. Continue pursuing largest army (2 VP)
4. Aim for city upgrade at node 15 when I get more wheat and ore
5. Maintain production advantage over RED by strategic robber placement
</plan>

Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state to make the optimal decision.

## Game State Analysis

**My Position:**
- 2 VP (2 settlements)
- Resources: 1 🧱, 1 🐑, 1 🌾, 3 ⛏️
- 1 Knight played (working toward Largest Army)

**Opponent's Position:**
- RED has 3 VP (3 settlements)
- RED has 7 cards (vulnerable to robber)
- RED has strong production with 3 settlements

**Production Analysis:**
- My production: Good ore (6★★★), wheat (8★★★), but limited sheep
- The robber is currently on wheat (8★★★), which impacts both me and RED

## Options Evaluation

**Option 0: End Turn**
- Pros: Save resources for future opportunities
- Cons: Miss opportunity to gain potential victory point or knight from development card

**Option 1: Buy Development Card (1 🐑, 1 🌾, 1 ⛏️)**
- Pros:
  * Could get Victory Point card (25% chance)
  * Could get Knight to advance toward Largest Army (40% chance)
  * Could get Year of Plenty or Monopoly for tactical advantage
  * Development cards are hidden, giving strategic advantage
  * Aligns with my development card-focused strategy
- Cons:
  * Uses all my sheep and wheat, limiting immediate building options
  * Not guaranteed to get a useful card

## Strategy Consideration

My current plan focuses on development cards and largest army. With RED ahead at 3 VP and having 7 cards, continuing my development card strategy makes sense. I've already played 1 Knight, so getting another would put me closer to Largest Army (2 VP).

<plan>
1. Buy development cards to pursue victory points and largest army
2. Collect ore and wheat for future city upgrade at node 15 
3. Target node 14 for my next settlement to access the 2:1 ore port
4. Continue disrupting RED's production with strategic robber placement
5. Calculate path to 10 VP: 2 settlements (2 VP) + 2-3 cities (4-6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + possible VP cards (1-2 VP)
</plan>

Since I have exactly the resources needed for a development card, and this aligns perfectly with my winning strategy, the optimal move is to purchase a development card.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and determine my optimal action:

## Current Position
- I have 2 VP (2 settlements) 
- I've played 1 knight card (need 2 more for largest army)
- I have 1 Year of Plenty development card
- Resources: 1 brick, 1 sheep, 2 ore
- My opponent (RED) has 3 VP with 3 settlements
- My robust producers are ore (6) and wheat (8) at node 15, but wheat is currently blocked by the robber

## Resource Needs Analysis
Looking at my plan:
1. Buy development cards (need wheat, sheep, ore)
2. Upgrade to city at node 15 (need 3 ore, 2 wheat)
3. Build settlement at node 14 to access ore port (need brick, wood, wheat, sheep)

With the robber on my wheat hex, I'm currently limited in production. I need to make optimal use of my Year of Plenty card to advance my strategy.

## Options Evaluation
I could:
1. Roll dice first, then decide how to use my Year of Plenty card based on what I roll
2. Use Year of Plenty now to get resources I need most

Since I have the opportunity to play Year of Plenty before rolling, I should use it to get resources that directly advance my strategy. Looking at my current resources (1 brick, 1 sheep, 2 ore), I need the following:

- For a development card: Need wheat + sheep (or more sheep)
- For city upgrade: Need 1 more ore + 2 wheat
- For new settlement expansion: Need wood + wheat + sheep (already have brick)

## Decision Making
The most efficient path forward is to pursue development cards for victory points and largest army (per my plan). With the robber on wheat (8), getting wheat through Year of Plenty makes sense.

Option [14]: Play Year of Plenty for sheep and wheat
- This gives me sheep (now 2) and wheat (now 1)
- Combined with my current resources, I could:
  * Buy a development card immediately (1 ore, 1 wheat, 1 sheep)
  * Still have 1 ore, 1 brick, and 1 sheep left for future builds

This aligns with my primary strategy of pursuing development cards and sets me up for further progress even with the robber on my wheat hex.

<plan>
1. Use Year of Plenty for wheat and sheep to bypass the robber
2. Buy development card to pursue victory points and largest army
3. Use knights strategically to move robber off my wheat production
4. Continue working toward city upgrade at node 15 when I have resources
5. Path to 10 VP: 2 settlements (2 VP) + 2-3 cities (4-6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + VP cards (0-2 VP)
</plan>

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and my available options:

## Current Resources
- 1 Brick, 2 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 2 Ore

## Victory Point Status
- I have 2 VPs (2 settlements)
- Opponent has 3 VPs (3 settlements)
- I've played 1 Knight card already
- I've played Year of Plenty already

## Available Actions
- [0] End Turn
- [1] Buy a Development Card (costs 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore)

## Resource Production Analysis
- My settlement at node 15 produces on ⛏️6 (high value), 🌾8 (high value), and 🐑4
- My settlement at node 10 produces on 🌲2 (low value), 🧱9, and 🧱5
- Unfortunately the robber is on the 🌾8 hex, blocking my wheat production

## Strategic Considerations
1. I only have 1 wheat, which limits my build options
2. Development cards could give me:
   - Victory Point card (hidden until end)
   - Knight (helps secure largest army & move robber)
   - Monopoly or Road Building (accelerate my strategy)
   - Year of Plenty (already played one)

3. My current plan emphasizes development cards for VPs and largest army
4. I currently have exactly the resources needed for a development card
5. I've already played 1 knight, so I'm on the path toward largest army (need 3 total)

<plan>
1. Buy development cards to pursue victory points and largest army
2. Use knights strategically to move robber off my wheat production
3. Continue working toward city upgrade at settlements when I have resources
4. Path to 10 VP: 2 settlements (2 VP) + 2-3 cities (4-6 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + VP cards (0-2 VP)
</plan>

Given the limited resources I have and the fact that my wheat production is blocked by the robber, buying a development card is the optimal move. This keeps me on track with my strategy of pursuing victory points through development cards and largest army. Additionally, if I draw a knight, I can use it to move the robber off my wheat hex, which would significantly improve my resource production.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis: Turn 22

I need to decide between playing a Knight card or rolling the dice. Let me analyze the current situation:

## Current Game State Analysis
- I (BLUE) have 2 VP (2 settlements)
- RED has 3 VP (3 settlements)
- I have 1 Knight already played, so I'm 1 knight away from potentially claiming Largest Army (2 VP)
- I have 1 BRICK and 1 SHEEP in my hand, plus 1 KNIGHT card
- The robber is currently on a sheep hex (-2, 1, 1), which doesn't affect my key production
- My settlements are producing ORE (6), WHEAT (8), SHEEP (4), BRICK (5,9), WOOD (2)

## Knight Card Analysis:
If I play the Knight card now:
1. I could move robber to target RED's best production (either BRICK 8 or WHEAT 8)
2. I'd steal a random card from RED (they have 3 cards)
3. I'd have 2 knights played, putting me in position for Largest Army (2 VP)

## Rolling Analysis:
If I roll the dice:
- Good rolls (5, 6, 8, 9) would give me resources to potentially buy a development card
- Bad rolls risk the robber activating (on 7) and possibly losing half my cards
- RED will continue to produce on their strong hexes if I roll

## Strategic Decision
Playing the Knight card now provides several advantages:
1. Disrupt RED's production by moving the robber to one of their 8-value hexes
2. Gain a random resource from RED
3. Position myself for Largest Army (2 VP)
4. Protect myself from a potential 7 roll where I might lose resources

<plan>
1. Play Knight card now to disrupt RED's production and position for Largest Army
2. Target RED's 8-value hex (either brick or wheat) with the robber
3. Continue buying development cards when possible to secure Largest Army (2 VP)
4. Focus on city upgrades when I have resources
5. Path to 10 VP: 2 settlements (2 VP) + 2 cities (4 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards (2 VP)
</plan>

Given that I have minimal resources currently and disrupting RED's production while positioning for Largest Army is critical, playing the Knight card now is the optimal choice.

# Analysis of Game State and Robber Placement Options

I need to determine the optimal hex to place the robber to maximize my strategic advantage while hindering RED who is currently ahead in victory points (3 vs my 2).

## Current Game Situation:
- RED has 3 VPs (3 settlements) vs my 2 VPs (2 settlements)
- I have only 1 brick and 1 sheep resource currently
- I've played 2 knights, so I'm working toward Largest Army (need 1 more knight)
- The robber is currently on a sheep hex (-2, 1, 1) with probability 4

## Key RED Player Production:
- RED has settlements on high-value hexes:
  - Settlement at node 5: produces from sheep-4, wheat-8, brick-8 (high probability 8s!)
  - Settlement at node 3: produces from sheep-4, wood-2, ore-6 (high probability 6)
  - Settlement at node 21: produces from brick-8, wheat-9, wood-10

## Best Robber Placement Strategy:
I should place the robber on a high-production hex that RED depends on, especially one with probability 6 or 8, and that allows me to steal from RED.

Looking at the options:
- Option [5]: Move robber to brick-8 (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED
  This disrupts a high-probability resource (8) that RED produces at both node 5 and node 21.

- Option [4]: Move robber to wheat-8 (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED
  This disrupts another high-probability resource (8) that RED produces at node 5.

Both options target critical RED production at valuable 8-value hexes.

Option [5] blocks RED's brick production at TWO settlements (nodes 5 and 21), while option [4] blocks wheat at only one settlement. Therefore, option [5] has a higher impact on disrupting RED's production.

<plan>
1. Place robber on brick-8 (0,1,-1) to block RED's brick production at two settlements
2. Continue working toward Largest Army by buying development cards when possible
3. Look to upgrade settlements to cities when I have wheat and ore
4. Path to 10 VP: 2 settlements (2 VP) + 2 cities (4 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards (2 VP)
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I'll place the robber on the brick-8 hex at (0,1,-1) and steal from RED.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

❓ Select action by number (0-1):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the game situation and decide on the best action.

### Current Game Status
- I have 2 VP from 2 settlements
- I have 3 Brick, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore
- I've played 2 Knights already (need 1 more for Largest Army)
- Red has 3 VP from 3 settlements

### Resource Analysis
My current resources: 3 Brick, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore

These resources allow me to:
1. Buy a development card (costs 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore)
2. End my turn and save resources

I don't have enough resources for roads (need Wood), settlements (need Wood), or cities (need more Ore and Wheat).

### Development Card Analysis
I already have 2 knights played, so buying a development card could potentially:
- Give me a 3rd Knight to secure Largest Army (2 VP)
- Give me a Victory Point card (1 VP, hidden until I win)
- Give me a useful action card (Monopoly, Road Building, Year of Plenty)

Given my current plan of working toward Largest Army and looking for hidden VP cards, buying a development card aligns perfectly with my strategy.

### Strategic Considerations
1. I'm currently at 2 VP, Red is at 3 VP
2. If I get Largest Army, that's +2 VP taking me to 4 VP
3. I'm already on track with my plan to get to 10 VP through cities, largest army, and VP cards
4. Saving resources risks losing them to a "7" roll or robber

### Decision
I should buy a development card because:
- It keeps me on track for my Largest Army goal (I need 1 more knight)
- It might give me a VP card
- It prevents me from losing resources to a "7" roll
- It helps me keep my VPs hidden until I'm ready to win

<plan>
1. Buy development cards when possible to work toward Largest Army (need 1 more Knight)
2. Continue accumulating ore and wheat for city upgrades
3. Look to expand with settlements if good locations open up
4. Path to 10 VP: 2 settlements (2 VP) + 2 cities (4 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards (2 VP)
</plan>

❓ Select action by number (0-1):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze this game state carefully to make the optimal decision.

## Current Game Assessment
- I have 2 visible VP + 1 hidden VP (victory point card) = 3 VP total
- RED has 3 visible VP
- I need 7 more VP to win, planning to get them from cities (4 VP), largest army (2 VP), and VP cards (1 more)
- I have 3 🧱BRICK, 1 🐑SHEEP, 2 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE
- I've already played 2 KNIGHT cards - I need 1 more to get largest army (2 VP)
- The robber is on a brick hex, but not affecting my production

## Available Options
1. Buy a development card (costs 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE)
2. End turn

## Option Analysis
If I buy a development card:
- I'd spend my only sheep, 1 wheat (leaving 1), and my only ore
- This could give me a Knight (25% chance), VP card (20% chance), Road Building, Year of Plenty, or Monopoly
- If it's a Knight, I'd gain largest army (2 VP) when played
- If it's a VP card, I'd gain another hidden VP

If I end my turn:
- I keep all resources for future use
- I might collect more on opponent's turn
- I could potentially buy a city next turn (needs 3 ore, 2 wheat)
- I'd still need more ore to meet my city-building goals

## Strategic Decision
Looking at my plan, I'm aiming for largest army and buying development cards is critical to that strategy. I already have 2 knights played, so just 1 more would give me largest army (2 VP). Also, any VP card would further advance my hidden victory points.

While saving resources could help toward a city, I'm currently far from having enough ore (I only have 1). The strategic value of potentially getting largest army or another VP card outweighs saving these resources for a future city that I can't build soon anyway.

<plan>
1. Buy development cards to secure largest army (need 1 more Knight)
2. Continue accumulating ore and wheat for city upgrades
3. Look to expand with settlements if good locations open up
4. Path to 10 VP: 2 settlements (2 VP) + 2 cities (4 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + VP cards (2+ VP)
</plan>

Based on this analysis, buying a development card is the optimal choice.

You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 32 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Buy development cards to secure largest army (need 1 more Knight)
2. Continue accumulating ore and wheat for city upgrades
3. Look to expand with settlements if good locations open up
4. Path to 10 VP: 2 settlements (2 VP) + 2 cities (4 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + VP cards (2+ VP)
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.
  To adjust your plan, provide a NEW PLAN in your reasoning with <plan>your new plan</plan>

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game situation and make the best strategic decision:

## Current Status
- I have 2 VP from 2 settlements
- I hold 1 hidden VP card (total of 3 VP)
- I have 2 knights played (need 1 more for largest army)
- Resources: 3 brick, 1 sheep, 1 wheat
- Development cards: 1 monopoly card, 1 victory point card
- Red player has 3 VP from settlements, 2 hidden cards

## Current Plan Evaluation
My plan to focus on development cards and cities is still valid, but I need to use my resources effectively. Let me consider my immediate options.

## Action Options Analysis
I can either play my Monopoly card or roll the dice.

### Option: Play Monopoly Card
The monopoly card lets me take all of one resource type from other players. The Red player has 2 cards, but I don't know which resources they are.

Most valuable targets to monopolize:
- ORE: Needed for cities and development cards, but low production for both of us
- WHEAT: Needed for cities and development cards, medium production
- BRICK: I already have 3, and Red might have some from their settlements

Given Red has 3 settlements producing brick, wood, ore, sheep, and wheat, there's a decent chance they might be holding ore or wheat which I need most.

### Option: Roll Dice
If I roll, I'll likely collect more resources to potentially buy a development card or build a road. I have good production on brick (9,5), wheat (8), sheep (4), and ore (6), though ore is currently blocked by the robber.

## Strategic Considerations
1. My priority is getting another knight to secure largest army (2 VP)
2. I need ore and wheat to buy development cards
3. Using Monopoly now gives me a small potential benefit (max 2 cards)
4. Saving Monopoly until players have accumulated more resources would yield better results

<plan>
1. Roll dice to collect more resources
2. Save Monopoly card for when players have more cards or when I need specific resources to complete a critical build
3. Continue buying development cards to secure largest army (need 1 more Knight)
4. Work toward city upgrades when I have enough ore and wheat
5. Path to 10 VP: 2 settlements (2 VP) + 2 cities (4 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + VP cards (2+ VP)
</plan>

Based on this analysis, the optimal move is to roll the dice, collect more resources, and save my Monopoly card for when it can have a greater impact. Red only has 2 cards, making Monopoly less effective now.

RESPONSE:
# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to make a smart decision about where to place the robber that will maximize my advantage while hindering my opponent who is currently ahead in victory points (3 VP vs my 2 VP).

## Key Considerations:
1. I want to block high-value hexes that RED is producing from
2. I want to steal a useful resource from RED if possible
3. I should avoid placing the robber on hexes that I heavily rely on
4. Looking at RED's settlements, they produce from:
   - 🐑4 (twice), 🌾8, 🧱8, 🌲2, ⛏️6, 🌾9, 🌲10

## Priority Analysis:
- RED already has 3 settlements to my 2, plus 2 hidden development cards
- The 8s are especially valuable (wheat and brick) and RED has both
- RED's settlement at node 5 produces from three good numbers (4, 8, 8)
- RED's settlement at node 21 produces from three good resources (8, 9, 10)

## Hex Evaluation:
- The 🌾8 hex (-1, 1, 0) hits RED's settlement at node 5, but also my settlement at node 15
- The 🧱8 hex (0, 1, -1) is currently blocked, and hits RED's settlements at nodes 5 and 21
- The ⛏️6 hex (-1, 0, 1) hits RED's settlement at node 3, but I should consider if I want ore

Looking at all the options where I can steal from RED (0, 2, 3, 4, 13, 14), the best choices are:
- Option 4: Block 🌾8 at (-1, 1, 0) - Blocks a high-value hex that RED produces from, but hurts me too
- Option 13: Block 🌾9 at (-1, 2, -1) - Blocks RED's wheat at node 21 without hurting me
- Option 14: Block 🌲10 at (0, 2, -2) - Blocks RED's wood at node 21

Since wheat is crucial for development cards and cities, and I don't want to block my own wheat production, option 13 is most strategic - blocking RED's 9 wheat without impacting my own production.

<plan>
1. Roll dice to collect more resources
2. Save Monopoly card for when players have more cards or when I need specific resources
3. Continue buying development cards to secure largest army (need 1 more Knight)
4. Work toward city upgrades when I have enough ore and wheat
5. Path to 10 VP: 2 settlements (2 VP) + 2 cities (4 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + VP cards (2+ VP)

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze the current game state and available actions to make the optimal strategic decision.

## Current Game State
- I have 2 VP (2 settlements)
- I have 1 hidden VP from a development card
- I need 7 more VP to win
- I have 2 knights played (need 1 more for largest army = 2 VP)
- Resources: 3 🧱BRICK, 1 🐑SHEEP, 2 🌾WHEAT
- Development cards: 1 MONOPOLY, 1 VICTORY_POINT

## Opponent Status
- RED has 3 VP (3 settlements)
- RED has 1 resource card and 2 development cards (hidden)
- RED has built 5 roads (longest: 4) - getting close to longest road

## My Options
I can either play my Monopoly card on one of the 5 resource types or end my turn.

## Monopoly Card Analysis
Monopoly lets me take all cards of one resource type from opponents. RED only has 1 resource card, so the maximum gain is 1 resource.

1. WOOD: If RED has wood, getting 1 wood would still leave me unable to build anything meaningful.
2. BRICK: I already have 3 brick. Getting 1 more brick wouldn't enable any critical builds.
3. SHEEP: If RED has sheep, getting 1 sheep + my existing 1 gives me 2 sheep, which might help for development card.
4. WHEAT: If RED has wheat, getting 1 wheat + my existing 2 gives me 3 wheat, which almost completes a city (need ore).
5. ORE: If RED has ore, getting 1 ore would be valuable since I have none, but still not enough for a development card.

## Current Strategic Assessment
- I'm behind on VP (2 vs 3)
- I need one more knight for largest army (2 VP)
- I need ore for both city upgrades and development cards
- Playing Monopoly now for potentially just 1 card is not optimal

The Monopoly card is more powerful when:
- Opponents have accumulated many resources
- I need a specific resource to complete a critical build
- I can deprive opponents of resources they need

## Decision
Playing Monopoly now would be a poor use of this valuable card, as the maximum gain is 1 resource. The better strategy is to save it for when RED has accumulated more resources, or when I desperately need a specific resource to complete a critical build.

<plan>
1. End turn now to maintain Monopoly for strategic use
2. Continue buying development cards to secure largest army (need 1 more Knight)
3. Work toward city upgrades when I have enough ore and wheat
4. Save Monopoly for when RED has accumulated more resources or when I need a specific resource urgently
5. Path to 10 VP: 2 settlements (2 VP) + 2 cities (4 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + VP cards (2+ VP)
</plan>

Therefore, I should end my turn and save the Monopoly card for a more strategic moment.

# Game Analysis and Decision Making

I'll analyze this game state in detail to make the optimal decision for BLUE.

## Current Game State Summary
- I'm BLUE with 2 visible victory points from my settlements
- I have 1 hidden victory point card (total 3 VP)
- RED has 3 visible victory points 
- Resources: 3 Brick, 1 Sheep, 2 Wheat
- Development Cards: 1 Monopoly, 1 Victory Point
- I have played 2 Knights (need 1 more for Largest Army)
- Current plan focuses on continuing to buy development cards

## My Options
I can either play my Monopoly card (on any resource type) or roll the dice.

### Option: Play Monopoly Card
Playing Monopoly now would collect all of one resource type from my opponent. This could be valuable if:
1. RED has accumulated a lot of a specific resource I need
2. I have an immediate build plan that requires a specific resource

Looking at my current resources (3 Brick, 1 Sheep, 2 Wheat), what am I missing?
- I need Ore for cities and development cards
- I need more Wood, Sheep, and Wheat for various builds

But there's a major problem - I don't know what resources RED has. They have 5 hidden cards, but I can't be certain which resources they are. Playing Monopoly now would be speculative and potentially wasteful.

### Option: Roll the Dice
Rolling allows me to collect more resources based on my settlements:
- Settlement at node 15: Ore(6), Wheat(8), Sheep(4) - high probability on Ore and Wheat
- Settlement at node 10: Wood(2), Brick(9), Brick(5) - decent probability on Brick

If I roll a 6 or 8, I get valuable Ore or Wheat which helps with my development card strategy.

## Strategic Considerations

1. **Resource Accumulation**: Rolling gives me more resources to work with.
2. **Monopoly Timing**: The Monopoly card is most valuable when:
   - I know my opponent has accumulated specific resources I need
   - I'm ready to make a big build and need one specific resource
   - I can deny my opponent critical resources they need for their next build
3. **Development Card Strategy**: My current plan is to get 1 more Knight for Largest Army (2 VP)
4. **Future Builds**: I need Ore and Wheat for cities and development cards

## Decision

Rolling is the best choice now because:
1. I need to gather more resources before making significant builds
2. Monopoly has much higher value when played with better information about opponent's resources
3. I should save Monopoly for when I know RED has accumulated resources I need
4. There's a good chance of rolling 6 or 8 to get valuable Ore or Wheat

<plan>
1. Roll the dice to gather more resources
2. Continue buying development cards to secure largest army (need 1 more Knight)
3. Work toward city upgrades when I have enough ore and wheat
4. Save Monopoly for when RED has accumulated more resources or when I need a specific resource urgently
5. Path to 10 VP: 2 settlements (2 VP) + 2 cities (4 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + VP cards (2+ VP)
</plan>

Therefore, I choose to roll the dice:

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:

- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis and Decision Making

Let me analyze the current game state and my available options carefully:

## Current Game Status
- I have 2 visible victory points (2 settlements)
- I have 1 hidden victory point from a development card
- I've played 2 knights (need 1 more for largest army which is 2 VP)
- Resources: 3 brick, 1 sheep, 2 wheat (no ore or wood currently)
- I have a Monopoly card ready to play

## Opponent Status
- RED has 3 visible victory points (3 settlements)
- RED has 7 hidden resource cards
- RED has 1 hidden development card
- RED has played 1 knight

## Available Actions
I can either play my Monopoly card for one of the 5 resources, or I can end my turn.

## Strategic Analysis

For the Monopoly card, I need to determine which resource would be most valuable:
1. WOOD: Needed for roads and settlements. RED may have some as they've built many roads.
2. BRICK: I already have 3 brick, but more would help with settlements or roads. Unlikely RED has much since building requires pairs.
3. SHEEP: Needed for development cards. With RED holding 7 cards, they might have some sheep.
4. WHEAT: Needed for settlements, cities, and development cards. Very versatile resource.
5. ORE: Critical for cities and development cards. High-value target.

Looking at my plan, I'm aiming for:
- Getting one more knight for largest army (+2VP)
- Building cities (need ore and wheat)
- I already have 2 wheat but no ore

Since RED has 7 cards and they've been building roads and settlements, they likely have accumulated some valuable resources. The most critical resource I'm missing is ORE, which I need for cities and development cards.

Also, I need to consider that RED is in danger of having to discard half their cards if a 7 is rolled, so this could be a good time to take resources from them.

## Decision
Playing the Monopoly card for ORE seems most strategic, as:
1. It's the resource I'm completely missing
2. It's critical for my city upgrade strategy
3. RED likely has some ore from their ore-producing settlements
4. It enables me to potentially buy a development card (for a knight) or save for city upgrades

<plan>
1. Play Monopoly for ORE now to secure resources I'm missing
2. If I get enough ore, buy development cards to secure largest army (need 1 more Knight)
3. If I get substantial ore, save for city upgrades when combined with my wheat
4. Continue expanding strategically toward key resources
5. Path to 10 VP: 2 settlements (2 VP) + 2 cities (4 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + VP cards (2 VP)
</plan>

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze my current situation and available options:

## Current Status
- I have 2 VP (2 settlements, including a hidden VP card)
- Resources: 5 🧱BRICK, 1 🐑SHEEP, 2 🌾WHEAT, 0 ⛏️ORE, 0 🌲WOOD
- Played Cards: 2 KNIGHT, 1 YEAR_OF_PLENTY, 1 MONOPOLY
- My opponent (RED) has 5 VP (3 settlements + longest road)
- I need 1 more knight for largest army (+2 VP)

## Analyzing My Position
- I'm behind in the VP race (2 vs 5)
- I need more ORE urgently for development cards or cities
- My brick stockpile (5) is excessive and should be converted to more useful resources
- I need to execute on my plan to get largest army and develop cities

## Available Actions
- [0] End turn (doing nothing)
- [1-4] Trade ports: Give 4 🧱BRICK for 1 of WOOD, SHEEP, ORE, or WHEAT

## Strategic Considerations
1. **Development Card Path**: I need ORE to buy development cards to secure largest army
2. **City Upgrades**: I need ORE + WHEAT for city upgrades
3. **Resource Efficiency**: Brick is my least useful resource right now

Looking at my current plan and resources, trading for ORE makes the most strategic sense. I can convert my excess brick to get 1 ORE, which puts me closer to buying a development card (which requires ORE + WHEAT + SHEEP).

I already have 1 SHEEP and 2 WHEAT, so acquiring 1 ORE would position me to potentially buy a development card next turn if I get a bit more ORE.

<plan>
1. Trade brick for ORE now to diversify resources
2. Aim to collect enough resources for a development card next turn to secure largest army (need 1 more Knight)
3. Continue focus on ORE and WHEAT acquisition for city upgrades
4. Path to 10 VP: 2 settlements (2 VP) + 2 cities (4 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + VP cards (2 VP)
</plan>

The optimal action is to trade 4 brick for 1 ORE:

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis

Let me evaluate the current situation and my options carefully:

## Current Game State
- I have 2 visible VP + 1 hidden VP (card) = 3 VP total
- Red has 5 VP (3 settlements + 2 VP for longest road)
- I need 7 more VP to win
- I have 1 BRICK, 1 SHEEP, 2 WHEAT, 1 ORE
- I've played 2 knights, need 1 more to secure largest army (+2 VP)
- Red has only played 1 knight

## Available Actions
[0] End turn
[1] Buy a development card (costs 1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE)

## Resource Analysis
- I have exactly the resources needed to buy a development card
- I have no resources to build roads, settlements, or cities
- Buying a development card could give me:
  * Knight (most common) → would secure largest army (2 VP)
  * Victory Point card → would gain 1 more hidden VP
  * Year of Plenty/Monopoly/Road Building → tactical advantage

## Strategic Considerations
1. Red is at 5 VP and ahead of me
2. Purchasing a development card aligns with my current plan
3. Securing largest army would be a significant 2 VP boost
4. The development card offers hidden information advantage
5. There's no other productive build I can complete this turn

<plan>
1. Buy development card now to potentially secure largest army (need 1 more Knight)
2. Continue focusing on ORE and WHEAT acquisition for city upgrades
3. Path to 10 VP: 2 settlements (2 VP) + 2 cities (4 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + VP cards (2+ VP)
4. If I get a VP card, I'll be at 4 VP total (1 visible + 3 hidden), putting me in striking distance
</plan>

## Decision
The optimal play is to purchase a development card. This aligns with my development card strategy, potentially securing largest army (2 VP), and it's the only productive action I can take with my current resources.

# Analysis of the Game State and Options

Let me analyze the current game state carefully to make the optimal decision:

## Current Situation Assessment
- I have 2 visible VPs (2 settlements) and 1 hidden VP (development card)
- I've played 2 knights, so I'm 1 knight away from largest army (2 VP)
- My opponent has 5 VPs (3 settlements + longest road bonus)
- I have limited resources: only 1 brick and 1 wheat
- I have a Monopoly development card available to play

## Evaluating My Options
My options are to either play the Monopoly card for one of the resources, or roll the dice.

### Option: Play Monopoly
For Monopoly to be effective, my opponent should have a significant number of a particular resource. Since they have only 3 cards total, the maximum I could gain is 3 resources.

Looking at production:
- RED has good wheat production (8 and 9)
- RED has good brick production (8)
- RED has moderate ore production (6)
- RED has poor wood production (2 and 10)
- RED has poor sheep production (4)

The most likely resources RED might have accumulated are wheat, brick, or ore. However, with only 3 cards, the benefit is limited.

### Option: Roll the Dice
Rolling the dice would allow me to potentially gather more resources based on my production:
- I have excellent ore (6) and wheat (8) production
- I have decent brick production (5 and 9)
- I have poor wood (2) and sheep (4) production, with sheep currently blocked by the robber

## Strategic Considerations
My current plan is to aim for largest army and upgrade settlements to cities. To do this effectively, I need primarily ore and wheat.

Since I already have 1 wheat, gaining more ore would be most beneficial for development cards (to get another knight) or city upgrades.

<plan>
1. Roll dice to gather more resources
2. Continue focusing on ore and wheat acquisition
3. Buy development card next turn if possible to potentially secure largest army
4. Path to 10 VP: 2 settlements (2 VP) + 2 cities (4 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + VP cards (2+ VP)
</plan>

## Decision
Given that my opponent only has 3 resources total, playing Monopoly now would have minimal benefit. It's better to roll the dice, potentially gain more resources, and save the Monopoly for a more opportune time when the opponent has accumulated more of a specific resource that I need.

1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 38 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Roll dice to gather more resources
2. Continue focusing on ore and wheat acquisition
3. Buy development card next turn if possible to potentially secure largest army
4. Path to 10 VP: 2 settlements (2 VP) + 2 cities (4 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + VP cards (2+ VP)
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.
  To adjust your plan, provide a NEW PLAN in your reasoning with <plan>your new plan</plan>

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze the current game state and my available actions:

## Current Game Status
- I have 2 visible VP (from 2 settlements)
- I have 1 hidden VP (from a Victory Point card)
- I've already played 2 knights (need 3 for largest army)
- I only have 1 brick and 1 wheat resource
- I have a monopoly card available to play
- Red has 5 VP (3 settlements + longest road)

## Resource Analysis
- Red has 3 hidden resources
- I could potentially gain resources using my monopoly card
- My production is focused on brick (5,9), ore (6), wheat (8), and sheep (4)
- The robber is on a sheep hex (-2,1,1), but doesn't affect my production

## Action Options
I can either play my monopoly card for different resources or end my turn.

## Monopoly Card Analysis
Let's analyze what I'd gain by playing monopoly:
- Wood: Red has at least some wood production (nodes 3, 21) - potential value
- Brick: Red has strong brick production (nodes 5, 21) - high probability
- Sheep: Red has some sheep production (nodes 3, 5) - moderate probability
- Wheat: Red has strong wheat production (nodes 5) - good probability
- Ore: Red has ore production (node 3) - moderate probability

## Strategic Priorities
Per my plan, I need:
- Ore + wheat to upgrade settlements to cities (5 points)
- Brick + wood for roads and settlements
- Knights to gain largest army (need one more)
- I need to catch up to Red who leads with 5 VP

## Decision Process
1. I have very limited resources (just 1 brick, 1 wheat)
2. Red likely has accumulated resources after several turns
3. I need multiple resource types to advance my strategy
4. Monopoly's highest value is when my opponent has accumulated that resource
5. Red has strong brick production (8, 9) - makes this the most likely resource to collect

<plan>
1. Use monopoly to collect brick from Red
2. Use collected brick to build roads for expansion
3. Continue focusing on development cards for knights to secure largest army
4. Path to 10 VP: 2 settlements (2 VP) + 2 cities (4 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + VP cards (2 VP)
</plan>

Given Red's strong brick production (nodes with 8 and 9 rolls), I believe the most strategic move is to play monopoly for brick. This will likely give me the most resources and prevent Red from further expanding their road network.

❓ Select action by number (0-17):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state and determine the best location to move the robber.

First, let me understand the overall situation:
- I'm BLUE with 2 VP (plus 1 hidden VP card), so I'm at 3/10 VP
- RED has 5 VP (including 2 VP for longest road)
- I have 2 brick and 1 wheat resources currently
- I need to move the robber from its current position at (-2, 1, 1)

When moving the robber, I want to:
1. Block a high-probability tile that RED produces from
2. Prioritize blocking resources RED needs to expand
3. Avoid blocking my own production
4. Place it where I can steal a useful resource

Looking at RED's settlements:
- RED has settlements at nodes 5, 3, and 21
- These produce from:
  - Node 5: 🐑4, 🌾8, 🧱8 (high probability wheat and brick)
  - Node 3: 🐑4, 🌲2, ⛏️6 (high probability ore)
  - Node 21: 🧱8, 🌾9, 🌲10 (high probability brick and decent wheat)

The highest value resources for RED are:
1. 🧱8 at (0, 1, -1) - produces at nodes 5 and 21
2. ⛏️6 at (-1, 0, 1) - produces at node 3
3. 🌾8 at (-1, 1, 0) - produces at node 5

Looking at option [5] Move robber to (0, 1, -1), this would:
- Block a brick 8 hex that produces for RED at two different settlements
- Brick is critical for RED to continue expanding their road network
- This doesn't block any of my production
- I can potentially steal from RED since they have a settlement at node 21

Option [4] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) would block a wheat 8 hex, which is also good, but the brick 8 is more critical to block since RED has it producing at two settlements and needs brick to continue expanding their road advantage.

Looking at my plan, I need brick to build roads, but I'm planning to use a monopoly card to collect brick from RED. Blocking RED's brick production will help ensure they have less brick when I play my monopoly card later.

<plan>
1. Move robber to brick 8 hex to block RED's primary brick production
2. Use monopoly to collect brick from RED in a future turn
3. Use collected brick to build roads for expansion
4. Continue focusing on development cards for knights to secure largest army
5. Path to 10 VP: 2 settlements (2 VP) + 2 cities (4 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + VP cards (2 VP)
</plan>

After careful analysis, my decision is to move the robber to the brick 8 hex at (0, 1, -1).

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

I'll analyze the current game state and available options to determine the optimal move.

## Current Status Assessment

- I'm BLUE with 2 visible VP, plus 1 hidden VP from a development card (total 3 VP)
- RED has 5 VP (3 settlements + longest road)
- I have resources: 4 Brick, 2 Wheat, 2 Ore
- The robber is on a Brick 8 hex (good placement blocking RED's production)
- My current plan focuses on development cards and largest army

## Options Analysis

1. **End Turn (Option 0)**
   - Pros: I keep my current resources for next turn
   - Cons: I'm not making use of trading opportunities with 4 brick
   
2. **Maritime Trade (Options 1-4)**
   - I have 4 brick which I could trade for any resource
   - Since my plan involves development cards, I should prioritize ore/wheat/sheep

## Strategic Evaluation

Looking at my resources and position:
- I have 2 wheat + 2 ore but need 1 sheep to buy a development card
- Option 2 (trade for sheep) would allow me to buy a development card
- I've played 2 knights already, meaning I'm tied with RED for largest army
- One more knight could give me largest army (2 VP)

## Path to Victory Update

My current path calculation:
- 2 settlements (2 VP) 
- 2 cities (4 VP) - not built yet
- Largest army (2 VP) - need 1 more knight
- VP cards (2 VP) - I already have 1, need more

Trading for sheep would help me buy a development card, which could be a knight (allowing me to get largest army) or a victory point card.

<plan>
1. Trade 4 brick for 1 sheep via maritime trade
2. Buy a development card with 1 wheat + 1 ore + 1 sheep
3. Focus on securing largest army (need 1 more knight)
4. Continue resource collection for city upgrades (need more ore/wheat)
5. Revised path to 10 VP: 2 settlements (2 VP) + 2 cities (4 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + VP cards (2+ VP)
</plan>

Since trading for sheep aligns with my development card strategy and gives me the best chance at largest army, I should choose Option 2.

❓ Select action by number (0-1):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll carefully analyze the current game state to determine the optimal action.

## Current Game State Analysis
- I have 2 victory points from settlements
- I have 1 hidden victory point card
- I've played 2 knights (need 1 more to get largest army bonus worth 2 VP)
- Red has 5 visible victory points (3 settlements + longest road)
- Resources: 1 sheep, 2 wheat, 2 ore
- Development cards remaining in bank: 17

## Option Analysis

**Option 0: End Turn**
- I would keep my resources for future turns
- No immediate progress toward victory points
- Risks losing resources to a '7' roll or targeted robber

**Option 1: Buy Development Card (1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore)**
- Costs 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore, leaving me with 1 wheat and 1 ore
- Potential outcomes:
  - Knight card (42% chance): Would give me largest army (2 VP)
  - Victory Point card (20% chance): Would give me another hidden VP
  - Year of Plenty or Monopoly: Tactical advantages for resource acquisition

## Strategic Considerations
1. If I draw a knight, I immediately gain largest army (2 VP), putting me at 5 VP total (including my hidden VP card)
2. Getting largest army now is critical because RED already has 2 knights played too
3. Even if I don't get a knight, any development card is valuable
4. My current plan focuses on securing largest army
5. I have the exact resources needed for a development card
6. Ending my turn without using my resources is risky and inefficient

## Decision
The optimal play is clearly to purchase a development card. This directly advances my established strategy of pursuing largest army, has a good chance of giving me a knight (42% probability), and protects my resources from being lost to a "7" roll.

<plan>
1. Buy a development card now, hoping for a knight to secure largest army
2. If I get a knight, play it next turn to secure largest army (2 VP)

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 52 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

# Game Analysis

I'll analyze the current game state and decide between playing my knight card now or rolling the dice.

## Current Situation
- I have 2 VP from settlements + 1 hidden VP card = 3 VP total
- Red has 5 VP (3 from settlements + 2 from longest road)
- I have 2 knights played already, and 1 more in hand
- Red has 2 knights played
- The robber is on a brick hex (0, 1, -1) with an 8 value (very productive)
- I have only 1 wheat and 1 ore in hand

## Knight Card Option Analysis
If I play my knight card now:
1. I'd get the largest army bonus (+2 VP), bringing me to 5 VP total
2. I could move the robber from the 8-brick hex to target Red's most productive hex
3. I could steal a resource from Red (who has 6 cards)
4. This would be a significant advancement toward my 10 VP goal

## Roll Dice Option Analysis
If I roll the dice:
1. I might get more resources to make progress toward my city upgrades
2. But if I roll a 7, I would activate the robber without getting the benefit of my knight card
3. The robber is currently on an 8-brick hex that produces for Red but not for me, so rolling has minimal downside compared to keeping the robber where it is

## Development Card Strategy Review
My plan revolves around using development cards for victory, particularly securing largest army. Playing the knight now activates this key component of my strategy by giving me the largest army bonus.

## Resource Position
With only 2 resources in hand, I'm not in a strong position to build anything significant after rolling. I need more resources either way.

<plan>
1. Play knight now to secure largest army (2 VP)
2. Move robber to Red's 8-wheat or 6-ore hex to disrupt their production
3. Continue gathering ore/wheat for city upgrades (need 6 ore, 2 wheat total)
4. Current path to 10 VP: 2 settlements (2 VP) + 2 cities (4 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + VP cards (2 VP)
</plan>

Given my development card-focused strategy, playing the knight now is clearly optimal as it immediately gives me 2 VP from largest army and brings me to parity with Red at 5 VP each. Additionally, I can disrupt Red's production and potentially steal a valuable resource.

# Game Analysis and Robber Placement Decision

I need to decide where to place the robber. This is a critical decision as it can disrupt my opponent's production while potentially giving me a resource I need.

## Current Game State Analysis
- I (BLUE) have 4 VP: 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + hidden victory point card
- RED has 5 VP: 3 settlements (3 VP) + longest road (2 VP)
- RED is ahead by 1 VP and has more settlements producing resources
- I need ore and wheat primarily for my city upgrade strategy
- RED has 6 hidden resource cards

## Key Production Analysis
RED's settlements produce from important hexes:
- 🧱8 (0, 1, -1): Currently has robber
- 🌾8 (-1, 1, 0): High-value wheat (8)
- ⛏️6 (-1, 0, 1): High-value ore (6)

## Best Robber Placements

Looking at my options, the most strategic placements would be:

1. Option [4] - Move to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED
   - This blocks RED's wheat production on the high-probability 8 hex
   - RED has a settlement at node 5 producing from this hex
   - Wheat is crucial for city upgrades and development cards

2. Option [3] - Move to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED
   - This blocks RED's ore production on the high-probability 6 hex
   - RED has a settlement at node 3 producing from this hex
   - Ore is the most critical resource for my city upgrade strategy

3. Option [13] - Move to (-1, 2, -1) and steal from RED
   - This blocks RED's wheat production from the 9 hex
   - RED has a settlement at node 21 producing from this hex

## Decision Making
Since my plan is to build cities and I'm short on both ore and wheat:
- Blocking RED's ore production (option 3) is most important since ore is rarer and critical
- By placing the robber on the 6-ore hex, I'm disrupting RED's city-building capacity
- I might also steal an ore card from RED, which would be highly beneficial
- This directly supports my current plan to gather resources for city upgrades

<plan>
1. Move robber to RED's 6-ore hex to disrupt their production and potentially steal ore
2. Continue gathering ore/wheat for city upgrades (need 6 ore, 2 wheat total)
3. Consider playing another knight if my high-production hexes get blocked
4. Current path to 10 VP: 2 settlements (2 VP) + 2 cities (4 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + VP cards (2 VP)
</plan>

Therefore, my optimal move is option [3] - Move to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Turn 58

I'll analyze the current game state and determine the best action.

## Current Situation
- I have 4 VP (2 settlements + largest army bonus)
- RED has 7 VP (3 settlements + 1 city + longest road)
- I have 4 wheat, 2 ore, and 1 hidden victory point card
- My goal is to reach 10 VP via: 2 settlements (2 VP) + 2 cities (4 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + VP cards (2 VP)
- Robber is on a sheep hex, not blocking any critical production

## Resource Analysis
- For my next city upgrade, I need 3 ore and 2 wheat
- I currently have 2 ore and 4 wheat
- I'm short 1 ore for a city upgrade

## Available Actions
- [0] End turn
- [1-4] Trade wheat for other resources using the 4:1 general trade rate

## Decision Process
Looking at my current resources, I have 2 ore and 4 wheat. I need 3 ore and 2 wheat for a city upgrade. Trading 4 wheat for 1 ore would give me exactly what I need for a city upgrade, which would advance me toward my victory condition.

However, I need to consider if this is the optimal move:
1. RED is at 7 VP and closing in on victory
2. I'm at 4 VP + 1 hidden VP = 5 VP total
3. Converting a settlement to a city would give me +1 VP

The 4:1 trade rate is inefficient, but I have an abundance of wheat and desperately need ore to progress. Having a city will increase my production power for future turns and get me one step closer to my victory condition.

Since I have the ore port at nodes 32-33 (where I have a road), I should be able to trade at 2:1 for ore in future turns if I accumulate more wheat, making future trades more efficient.

<plan>
1. Trade 4 wheat for 1 ore to get the 3 ore needed for a city upgrade
2. Build city next turn (assuming no robber interference)
3. Continue gathering resources for second city
4. Consider building roads to expand to new settlement locations
5. Hold VP card until I can win in a single turn
</plan>

Based on this analysis, the optimal action is to trade 4 wheat for 1 ore:

# Game Analysis: Robber Placement Decision

Let me analyze the current game state and make a strategic robber placement decision.

## Game State Overview
- BLUE (me): 4 VP (including 2 VP from largest army)
  - Hidden 1 VP card, so actually 5 VP total
  - Resources: 1 brick, 1 wheat, 3 ore
- RED: 8 VP (including 2 VP from longest road)
  - 1 hidden resource card
  - Very close to winning

## Key Priorities
1. RED is at 8 VP and very close to winning - MUST block RED's progress
2. I need to continue with my city upgrade plan (need 2 ore, 3 wheat)
3. Ideal robber placement should:
   - Block RED's high-value production
   - Potentially steal a useful resource
   - Protect my own high-value hexes

## Analyzing Robber Placement Options

RED's buildings produce:
- City at node 5: 🐑4[⭐], 🌾8[⭐⭐⭐], 🧱8[⭐⭐⭐]
- Settlement at node 3: 🐑4[⭐], 🌲2, ⛏️6[⭐⭐⭐]
- City at node 21: 🧱8[⭐⭐⭐], 🌾9[⭐⭐], 🌲10[⭐]
- Settlement at node 13: ⛏️6[⭐⭐⭐], 🌾10[⭐], 🐑5[⭐⭐]

Looking at the highest value productions for RED:
- Brick 8 (hex 0,1,-1) - produces for nodes 5 and 21 (both RED's buildings)
- Wheat 8 (hex -1,1,0) - produces for nodes 5 (RED city) and 15 (MY settlement)
- Ore 6 (hex -1,0,1) - produces for nodes 3 (RED settlement) and 13 (RED settlement) and 15 (MY settlement)

Best robber placement targets:
- Option [5] Brick 8 hex (0,1,-1): This blocks a high-probability brick resource for RED's city and settlement, but doesn't affect my production.
- Option [4] Wheat 8 hex (-1,1,0): This blocks a high-probability wheat resource, but hurts my settlement at node 15 as well.
- Option [3] Ore 6 hex (-1,0,1): This blocks ore production, but hurts my settlement at node 15 too.

Since RED is at 8 VP and only needs 2 more to win, my priority is to severely hamper RED's ability to build, even at my own expense.

Looking at option [5] - placing the robber on the Brick 8 hex (0,1,-1):
- This blocks RED's highest probability brick production
- RED has two buildings connected to this hex (city and settlement)
- It doesn't affect my own production
- I can steal a card from RED

<plan>
1. Block RED's brick production with robber placement
2. Continue accumulating resources for city upgrade (need 2 more wheat)
3. Build city when possible
4. Continue working toward second city
5. Hold VP card for surprise win
</plan>

Option [5] to place the robber on the Brick 8 hex (0,1,-1) gives the most strategic advantage by blocking a crucial RED resource while preserving my own production.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Turn 62

I'll analyze the current game state and available options to determine the optimal move.

## Current Situation
- I (BLUE) have 4 VP: 2 settlements (2 VP) and Largest Army (2 VP), plus 1 hidden Victory Point card
- RED has 8 VP: 2 settlements (2 VP), 2 cities (4 VP), and Longest Road (2 VP)
- RED is just 2 VP away from winning
- I have 1 🧱BRICK, 2 🌾WHEAT, 3 ⛏️ORE in my hand
- The robber is currently on a brick hex (0, 1, -1) with value 8 (high production)

## Available Actions
1. Upgrade settlement at node 15 to a city (Cost: 2 🌾WHEAT, 3 ⛏️ORE)
2. Upgrade settlement at node 10 to a city (Cost: 2 🌾WHEAT, 3 ⛏️ORE)
3. End my turn without building

## Decision Analysis

This is a critical moment in the game. RED is at 8 VP and could potentially win on their next turn. I need to advance my position quickly.

I have exactly enough resources to upgrade one settlement to a city (2 wheat, 3 ore). This would give me +1 VP, taking me to 5 VP (visible) + 1 VP (hidden) = 6 VP total.

Node 15 produces:
- ⛏️6 (high production - 3 dots)
- 🌾8 (high production - 3 dots)
- 🐑4 (low production - 1 dot)

Node 10 produces:
- 🌲2 (low production)
- 🧱9 (medium production - 2 dots)
- 🧱5 (medium production - 2 dots)

Upgrading node 15 is clearly superior since:
1. It produces high-value ore and wheat (exactly what I need for more cities)
2. The numbers are better (6 and 8 vs. 2, 9, and 5)
3. Resource diversity is better (ore, wheat, sheep vs. wood and double brick)

By upgrading node 15, I'll double my production of ore and wheat when these numbers are rolled, which accelerates my ability to build more cities or buy development cards.

<plan>
1. Upgrade settlement at node 15 to a city this turn
2. Focus on accumulating resources for another city or development cards
3. Work toward 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
4. Hold VP card for surprise win
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I should upgrade my settlement at node 15 to a city.

Let me analyze the current game state and available options:

## Game Status Assessment
- **My Points**: 5/10 (1 city = 2 VP, 1 settlement = 1 VP, largest army = 2 VP)
- **RED Points**: 8/10 (2 cities = 4 VP, 2 settlements = 2 VP, longest road = 2 VP)
- **My Resources**: 1 🧱BRICK, 4 🌾WHEAT, 2 ⛏️ORE
- **Development Cards**: 1 VICTORY_POINT card (hidden)
- **Objective**: I need 4 more points to win (already have 6 including the hidden VP)

## Current Situation
RED is dangerously close to winning with 8/10 points. They need just 2 more points, which could come from:
- 1 more city
- 2 more settlements
- Development cards with victory points

## My Resources and Options
With my current resources (1 🧱, 4 🌾, 2 ⛏️), I'm close to upgrading a settlement to a city (costs 3 🌾 + 2 ⛏️). However, I'm 2 🌾 short of getting a development card (1 🐑 + 1 🌾 + 1 ⛏️).

Available actions:
- [0] End turn
- [1-4] Various port trades giving up 4 🌾 for other resources

## Strategic Analysis
1. **Option: Upgrade to City**
   - I have 4 🌾 and 2 ⛏️, which is perfect for upgrading my settlement to a city
   - However, I don't see any option to build a city in the available actions list
   - This might mean I don't have a settlement available to upgrade, or the action is missing

2. **Option: Buy Development Card**
   - Need 1 🐑, 1 🌾, 1 ⛏️ - I'm missing 🐑
   - I could trade 4 🌾 for 1 🐑 (Action #2)
   - But this leaves me with no resources

3. **Option: End Turn**
   - Conserve my resources
   - Hope for good rolls next turn
   - Risk RED getting closer to winning

## Plan Reassessment
My current plan was to upgrade settlement at node 15 to a city, but there's a critical issue: node 15 appears to already be a city according to the BUILDINGS section (🏙️ at node 15).

<plan>
1. End my turn to conserve resources
2. Focus on development cards with my next resources to increase victory points or get control of robber
3. Work toward another city (likely 3 VP cards + 2 cities + 2 settlements + largest army)
4. Continue holding VP card for surprise win
</plan>

## Final Decision
Since I can't upgrade node 15 (it's already a city) and trading 4 wheat for another resource isn't efficient, I should conserve my resources. The best action is to end my turn.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

# Game Analysis for Turn 68

Let me thoroughly analyze the current game state to determine the optimal action.

## Current Game State Summary:
- **My Position**: 5 VP (1 settlement, 1 city, largest army bonus, 1 hidden VP card)
- **Opponent Position**: 9 VP (1 settlement, 3 cities, longest road bonus)
- **Resources I Have**: 1 Brick, 4 Wheat, 4 Ore
- **Notable Production**: My city at node 15 produces on valuable numbers (6, 8)
- **Current Threat**: Opponent is at 9 VP, just 1 point away from winning

## Strategic Considerations:

1. **Opponent is 1 VP away from winning**: This is critical - RED is at 9 VP and could win on their next turn. Defense is no longer an option - I need to find a way to win immediately or at least strengthen my position significantly.

2. **Available Actions**: 
   - Option 1: Upgrade settlement to city (costs 2 Wheat, 3 Ore)
   - Options 2-9: Various maritime trades

3. **Impact of City Upgrade**:
   - Would increase my VP from 5 to 6
   - Would improve production at node 10 (produces on 2, 5, 9)
   - Would leave me with 2 Wheat, 1 Ore

4. **Path to Victory Assessment**:
   - I have 5 VP now (+ 1 hidden VP = 6 VP total)
   - If I build a city, I'll have 6 VP (+ 1 hidden VP = 7 VP total)
   - I would still need 3 more VP to win
   - RED is at 9 VP and will likely win on their next turn

## Decision Logic:

Building a city gives me an extra VP and improves my production. Given that RED is likely to win on their next turn, the only reasonable choice is to strengthen my position as much as possible. The city upgrade is the only action that provides a VP.

Trading resources would not improve my VP count and would leave me in a weaker position to capitalize on future dice rolls.

<plan>
1. Build city at node 10 to reach 6 VP (7 VP with hidden card)
2. On future turns, focus on getting development cards for potential victory points
3. Look to build additional settlements/cities if possible
4. Try to defend against RED winning on their next turn by establishing strong production
</plan>

Since RED is at 9 VP and almost certain to win on their next turn, my best move is to at least increase my point total and production by upgrading my settlement to a city.

# Game Analysis for Robber Placement

## Strategic Situation Assessment
- RED has 9 VP (6 visible from settlements/cities + 2 from longest road + 1 hidden)
- BLUE has 7 VP (4 visible from cities + 2 from largest army + 1 hidden victory point card)
- RED is 1 point away from winning, making them the primary target
- I need to maximize disruption to RED player

## Robber Placement Priorities
1. Target RED's highest-value production hexes
2. Prioritize hexes that produce resources RED likely needs for their next build
3. Maximize chance of stealing a useful resource for my own plans

## Analyzing RED's Settlements/Cities and Production
RED's buildings produce from these resources and dice numbers:
- 🏙️ at node 5: 🐑4, 🌾8(⭐⭐⭐), 🧱8(⭐⭐⭐)
- 🏠 at node 3: 🐑4, 🌲2, ⛏️6(⭐⭐⭐)
- 🏙️ at node 21: 🧱8(⭐⭐⭐), 🌾9(⭐⭐), 🌲10(⭐)
- 🏙️ at node 13: ⛏️6(⭐⭐⭐), 🌾10(⭐), 🐑5(⭐⭐)

The highest value hexes for RED are:
- 🧱8 (0,1,-1): ⭐⭐⭐ (City at node 5 and City at node 21)
- ⛏️6 (-1,0,1): ⭐⭐⭐ (City at node 13 and Settlement at node 3)  
- 🌾8 (-1,1,0): ⭐⭐⭐ (City at node 5)

## Evaluating Robber Options
Since RED is only 1 VP away from winning, my top priority is blocking their most valuable production.

Looking at options that target RED's buildings with high production value:
- [5] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) - This targets the 🧱8 hex which produces for TWO of RED's cities
- [3] Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) - This targets the ⛏️6 hex which produces for a city and settlement
- [4] Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) - This targets the 🌾8 hex which produces for a city

Option [5] is the most impactful because:
1. It blocks 🧱8 which has TRIPLE stars (⭐⭐⭐) and produces for TWO of RED's cities
2. At this stage, RED is likely trying to build their final settlement or development card
3. Brick is critical for settlement expansion (roads + settlement)
4. This hex provides no production for me, so I'm not hurting myself

<plan>
1. Block RED's 🧱8 production to slow their path to victory
2. Continue working toward city at node 10 to reach 6 VP (7 VP with hidden card)
3. Focus on getting development cards for potential additional victory points
4. Aim for at least one more settlement to reach 8-9 VP before revealing hidden VP card
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Initial Settlement Analysis

I need to choose my first settlement placement, which is a critical strategic decision that will shape the entire game. Let me analyze the board systematically by looking for the highest value nodes based on our initial placement strategy.

## Key Resources to Prioritize
- Ore and wheat are highest priority for city upgrades and development cards
- Need access to all resource types, ideally with good probabilities
- Want high-probability numbers (6, 8) on different resources

## Best Node Analysis
Let me analyze the most promising nodes by looking at their resource access and probability values:

Node 10:
- Connected to 🌲8 (wood), ⛏️10 (ore), and 🌾12 (wheat)
- Total probability value: 0.139 + 0.111 + 0.028 = 0.278
- Great ore/wheat combo for development cards and city strategy
- Good wood production on an 8

Node 8:
- Connected to 🌲5 (wood), 🌲9 (wood), and 🧱6 (brick)
- Total probability value: 0.111 + 0.083 + 0.111 = 0.305
- Great for roads but lacks ore/wheat for our development card strategy

Node 23:
- Connected to 🧱8 (brick), ⛏️11 (ore), and 🐑3 (sheep)
- Total probability value: 0.139 + 0.056 + 0.056 = 0.251
- Has ore for our strategy, but sheep is low probability

Node 11:
- Connected to 🌲8 (wood), ⛏️10 (ore), and 🌾12 (wheat)
- Total probability value: 0.139 + 0.111 + 0.028 = 0.278
- Same resources as node 10, equally good

Node 9:
- Connected to ⛏️10 (ore), 🌲5 (wood), and 🧱6 (brick)
- Total probability value: 0.111 + 0.111 + 0.111 = 0.333
- Good balanced node with ore, wood and brick

## Decision
Node 10 is optimal for our development card strategy:
- Gives access to 🌲8 (wood), ⛏️10 (ore), and 🌾12 (wheat)
- Provides the ore and wheat needed for development cards and cities
- Has a high-probability wood (8) for building settlements and roads
- Follows our "target ore and wheat" priority
- Will leave us options to expand toward other resources with our second settlement

The wheat is on a 12, which is low probability, but having ore on a good number (10) is crucial, and we have a strong wood income on an 8. This placement perfectly aligns with our development card victory strategy.

- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 0 | Player: BLUE | Action: BUILD_INITIAL_ROAD

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Block RED's 🧱8 production to slow their path to victory
2. Continue working toward city at node 10 to reach 6 VP (7 VP with hidden card)
3. Focus on getting development cards for potential additional victory points
4. Aim for at least one more settlement to reach 8-9 VP before revealing hidden VP card

❓ Select action by number (0-2):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I need to make a strategic decision about where to place my initial road from my settlement at node 10. Let me analyze the options carefully:

Option [0] - Road at edge (9, 10):
- Direction: Leads toward 🧱6 and potentially node 9 (connected to 🧱6, ⛏️10, 🌲5)
- Pros: Might give access to brick (which I currently lack)
- Cons: Less optimal for expansion as it doesn't move toward open areas

Option [1] - Road at edge (10, 11):
- Direction: Leads toward 🌾12 and 🌲8 areas
- Pros: Follows high-value wood (8) that I already produce, could lead to wheat areas
- Cons: Less expansion opportunity in that direction (edges of the board)

Option [2] - Road at edge (10, 29):
- Direction: Leads toward 🌲5 and 🧱 port
- Pros: 
  * Moves toward the brick port which would be valuable since I produce wood (8)
  * Opens path to good future settlement spots near both a 5 and port
  * Creates good expansion opportunities
  * Could later establish a settlement that produces brick while also accessing the brick port
- Cons: Not immediately moving toward a high-probability hex

Looking at my current production (⛏️10, 🌲5, 🌲8), I'm strong on wood but need a path to get ore, wheat, and brick for development. The brick port would be especially valuable given my abundant wood production.

<plan>
1. Build road toward brick port at edge (10, 29)
2. Continue working toward establishing a settlement near the brick port
3. Focus on securing ore and wheat production for city upgrades
4. Pursue development cards for hidden victory points and tactical advantages
5. Use brick port to maximize my wood (8) production value
</plan>

Road option [2] gives me the best expansion potential and strategic value for my strong wood production. It positions me toward the brick port which complements my existing resources.

\boxed{2}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 2 | Player: BLUE | Action: BUILD_INITIAL_SETTLEMENT

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:

# Initial Placement Strategy Analysis

I'm currently selecting my second initial settlement placement. This is a critical decision that will shape my entire game strategy.

Let me analyze the board and evaluate the optimal placement:

## Resource Analysis
I already have my first settlement at node 10, which produces:
- ⛏️ Ore (10) [⭐] - Average probability
- 🌲 Wood (5) [⭐⭐] - Below average probability
- 🌲 Wood (8) [⭐⭐⭐] - Excellent probability

My current resource production is strong in wood but lacks wheat, sheep, and brick. For an optimal development card strategy, I need to secure wheat, ore, and sheep.

## Best Node Options

Let me evaluate the most promising nodes:

### Node 11
- Resources: 🌾12 (wheat), 🌲8 (wood), ⛏️10 (ore)
- Pros: Complements my current ore production, adds wheat
- Cons: Adds more wood which I already have, 12 is low probability

### Node 13
- Resources: 🌾12 (wheat), 🌾11 (wheat), ⛏️10 (ore)
- Pros: Excellent wheat production, adds ore
- Cons: 11 and 12 are low probability

### Node 14
- Resources: 🌾11 (wheat), ⛏️2 (ore), 🌾4 (wheat)
- Pros: Access to wheat
- Cons: Very poor probabilities (2, 11, 4)

### Node 23
- Resources: 🧱8 (brick), ⛏️11 (ore), 🐑3 (sheep)
- Pros: Adds all missing resources (brick, sheep)
- Cons: Low probability on sheep (3)

### Node 32
- Resources: 🌲8 (wood), 🌾12 (wheat), 3:1 port access
- Pros: Adds wheat, 3:1 port
- Cons: More wood which I already have, low probability on wheat (12)

### Node 52/53
- Resources: 🧱8 (brick), 🐑3 (sheep), 2:1 ⛏️ ORE port
- Pros: Adds missing resources (brick, sheep), ore port
- Cons: Low probability on sheep (3)

## Strategic Considerations
1. For development card strategy, I need wheat, ore, and sheep
2. My current settlement is strong in wood (especially the 8)
3. I should diversify my resource production
4. Access to ports could be valuable

## Decision
Node 11 gives me good complementary resources with decent probabilities. It adds wheat while reinforcing my ore production, and I already have a road connection there.

<plan>
1. Place second settlement at node 11 to secure wheat and additional ore
2. Work toward getting a settlement at a sheep-producing hex
3. Focus on development cards with wheat/ore/sheep
4. Use my strong wood production (8) for trading and building roads strategically
5. Target city upgrades at high-producing settlements
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 2 | Player: BLUE | Action: BUILD_INITIAL_ROAD

❓ Select action by number (0-2):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll carefully analyze this initial placement phase for optimal positioning of my second road.

First, let's understand my current position:
- I have settlements at node 10 (produces ore, wood 5, wood 8) and node 12 (produces ore, wheat 4, wheat 12)
- I already have a road at (10, 29)
- I need to place my second initial road 
- I have strong wood production (the 8 is highly valuable) and decent ore
- My wheat production is mediocre (4 and 12 are low probability)
- I'm completely missing sheep and brick resources

Let's examine my three road options:

[0] Road at edge (12, 13):
- Connects my settlement at node 12 towards node 13
- Node 13 connects to wheat 12, wheat 11, and ore 2
- This extends towards the 3:1 port at nodes 32-33
- Provides expansion opportunities for more wheat and ore

[1] Road at edge (11, 12):
- Connects my two settlements at nodes 11 and 12
- Creates no immediate new expansion options

[2] Road at edge (3, 12):
- Connects my settlement at node 12 towards node 3
- Node 3 connects to ore 10, wheat 4, and sheep 4
- This could allow me to expand toward sheep production

Looking at my current plan, I need sheep for development cards. Option [2] moves me toward a hex with sheep 4, which addresses my sheep shortage. However, option [0] gives me access to potentially better spots with multiple resources including a path toward ports.

<plan>
1. Place second initial road at edge (12, 13) to expand toward wheat/ore and 3:1 port
2. Focus on acquiring brick to build roads toward sheep production
3. Target development cards once I secure sheep access
4. Use my strong wood production for trading
5. Prioritize city upgrades at my high-producing settlements
</plan>

Option [0] gives me the best strategic flexibility for future expansion toward both resources I need and a port. It allows me to potentially build toward node 13, which is connected to wheat and ore, and eventually toward the 3:1 port that would be valuable given my resource imbalance.

# Analyzing Robber Placement Options

I'll analyze the situation to determine the optimal hex to place the robber.

## Game State Analysis
- I'm BLUE with 2 Victory Points (2 settlements)
- RED also has 2 Victory Points (2 settlements)
- RED is building roads quickly (4 vs. my 2) and may be pursuing longest road
- I have strong wood production but need improvement in other resources
- The robber is currently at (1, -2, 1), which is a wood hex with value 5

## Priority Resource Analysis
Looking at RED's settlements:
- RED's settlement at node 2 produces sheep-4, brick-6, ore-10
- RED's settlement at node 7 produces brick-6, wood-9, brick-8
- RED is getting excellent brick production (two 6s and one 8)

## Robber Placement Goals
1. Block RED's highest-value resources
2. Target resources I need less of (not blocking my own trade options)
3. Choose a hex where I can steal from RED

## Option Evaluation

Looking at RED's high-value hexes:
- Option [1] - Move to (1, -1, 0): Brick-6 hex (high value ⭐⭐⭐)
- Option [17] - Move to (2, -1, -1): Brick-8 hex (high value ⭐⭐⭐)

These are excellent options since RED has exceptional brick production from both these hexes, which is fueling their road building strategy. Blocking either would significantly slow them down.

Option [2] - Move to (0, -1, 1): Ore-10 (high value ⭐) is also good, but I need ore myself, and blocking this would hurt my own node 12 production.

I should target RED's brick production since:
1. It will directly counter their road-building strategy
2. I don't depend on brick production myself
3. I might steal a brick that I need for my own expansion

Between options [1] and [17], option [17] targeting the brick-8 hex is slightly better since 8 is a higher probability number than 6.

<plan>
1. Block RED's brick production to slow their road building
2. Focus on building roads toward the sheep-producing regions when I get brick
3. Begin acquiring development cards once I have better sheep access
4. Continue to leverage my wood production for trading
5. Work toward city upgrades at my high-producing settlements
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:

# Analysis of Robber Placement Options

I need to carefully consider where to place the robber to maximize my strategic advantage while hindering my opponent RED who is currently ahead with 4 VP (including 2 VP from longest road).

## Game State Assessment:
- RED has 4 VP vs my 2 VP
- RED has the longest road (6 segments) giving them +2 VP
- RED has settlements producing valuable brick (at 6 and 8 probability)
- I have good wood production (5 and 8 probability) but limited other resources

## Robber Placement Options Analysis:

Looking at RED's settlements:
- Node 2: Produces sheep(4), brick(6), ore(10)
- Node 7: Produces brick(6), wood(9), brick(8)

RED's brick production is particularly strong with two settlements on 6 and 8 numbered brick hexes. This is fueling their road building strategy (already has 6 roads for longest road).

The most impactful options are:
1. Option [1]: Move to (1,-1,0) = Brick(6) hex connected to both RED's settlements
   * Blocks RED's strongest production (6 brick)
   * Impacts both of RED's settlements
   * Directly counters their road-building strategy

2. Option [17]: Move to (2,-1,-1) = Brick(8) hex
   * Blocks RED's other brick source (8)
   * Only affects one settlement

3. Option [2]: Move to (0,-1,1) = Ore(10) hex
   * Blocks RED's ore production
   * Also blocks my own ore from settlement at node 12

4. Option [7]: Move to (2,-2,0) = Wood(9) hex
   * Blocks RED's wood production
   * Less critical for their strategy than brick

<plan>
1. Block RED's primary brick production with the robber to slow their road building
2. Focus on acquiring development cards when I can gather resources
3. Work toward city upgrades at my high-producing settlements
4. Try to establish a settlement near the sheep port when I acquire brick
5. Keep tracking RED's VP progress while hiding my own development
</plan>

Optimal choice: Option [1] - Move robber to brick(6) hex at (1,-1,0) and steal from RED. This is the most strategic move as it blocks RED's strongest resource that's enabling their road building strategy. Brick(6) is an extremely productive hex (probability 6 is among the highest) and it impacts both of RED's settlements simultaneously.

❓ Select action by number (0-4):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state and determine the best action to take.

## Game State Analysis

1. **My Position:**
   - I have 2 VP (2 settlements)
   - Resources: 1 🌲WOOD, 4 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE
   - No development cards
   - Limited road network (just 2 roads)

2. **Opponent's Position:**
   - RED has 4 VP (2 settlements + longest road bonus)
   - RED has extensive road network (6-segment longest road)
   - RED has excellent brick production (both settlements on good brick hexes)

3. **Resource Production:**
   - My settlements produce wood, wheat, and ore
   - I lack good brick and sheep production

## Options Analysis

Let's consider my available actions:

**[0] End Turn**
- If I end my turn, I'll maintain my current resources and wait for the next roll.
- I currently have 4 wheat, which puts me at risk of losing half my cards if a 7 is rolled.
- I can't immediately build anything useful with my current resources.

**Maritime Trading Options [1-4]**
- I have 4 wheat, which is enough for a 4:1 port trade (I don't seem to have access to a wheat port)
- I could trade for brick, wood, sheep, or ore

Looking at my strategic needs:
- I need sheep + wheat + ore for development cards (my primary strategy)
- I need brick + wood for roads and settlements
- I need ore + wheat for city upgrades

## Decision Making

My original plan mentions:
- Blocking RED's brick production (already done - the robber is on the 🧱6 hex)
- Focusing on development cards
- Working toward city upgrades
- Establishing a settlement near the sheep port
- Tracking RED's progress

For development cards, I need sheep (which I don't have). For city upgrades, I need more ore (I only have 1). For expansion toward the sheep port, I need brick and wood.

Given my current resources (1 wood, 4 wheat, 1 ore), I'm closest to getting a development card if I can acquire sheep. My existing plan is still valid, but I need to address my immediate resource needs.

I should trade for sheep to work toward a development card since that aligns with my primary strategy.

<plan>
1. Trade for sheep to work toward development cards
2. Continue blocking RED's brick production with the robber
3. Focus on development cards as my path to victory
4. Work toward city upgrades at my high-producing settlements when possible
5. Try to establish a settlement near the sheep port when I gather brick and wood
</plan>

Therefore, I choose to trade 4 wheat for 1 sheep:

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for BLUE Player

Let me analyze the current game state carefully to determine the optimal move:

## Current Resources
- 1 🐑SHEEP
- 1 🌾WHEAT
- 2 ⛏️ORE

## Victory Point Status
- BLUE: 2 VP (visible from 2 settlements)
- RED: 4 VP (2 settlements + longest road)

## Available Actions
- [0] End turn
- [1] Buy a development card (costs 1 🐑, 1 🌾, 1 ⛏️)

## Action Analysis

For option [1] Buy Development Card:
- I have exactly the resources needed (1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore)
- Development cards provide multiple benefits:
  - Possible Victory Point card (immediate +1 hidden VP)
  - Knight card (defense against robber, progress toward largest army)
  - Progress cards (Year of Plenty or Monopoly) for resource advantage
- This aligns with my primary strategy of pursuing development cards
- RED is ahead with 4 VP, and I need to catch up

For option [0] End Turn:
- I'd keep my current resources
- But I'd make no progress toward victory
- Keeping resources risks losing them to a "7" roll or knight

## Strategic Considerations:
- RED has a strong position with 4 VP and longest road
- Development cards are my best path to victory (especially hidden VP cards)
- The robber is currently blocking one of my wood hexes, but I don't need wood right now
- I need to work toward largest army (2 VP) to counter RED's longest road bonus

<plan>
1. Continue investing in development cards whenever possible
2. Use knights strategically to both protect my resources and work toward largest army
3. Save resources for city upgrades when I accumulate enough ore and wheat
4. Build roads toward the sheep port to strengthen my ability to get development cards
5. Target RED's resource production with robber placement when possible
</plan>

Based on this analysis, buying a development card is clearly the optimal choice. It advances my path to victory, potentially provides immediate value, and helps me execute my development card-focused strategy.

❓ Select action by number (0-5):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the game state and determine the optimal action.

Current game state assessment:
- I have 2 victory points (2 settlements)
- RED has 4 victory points (2 settlements + longest road)
- I have 3 ORE and 1 MONOPOLY development card
- I'm early in my development with only 2 roads
- My resources are limited, so I need to make a strategic decision

Options analysis:

1) Playing Monopoly card:
   - WOOD: My settlements produce wood (tiles with 5 and 8), so this seems less valuable
   - BRICK: RED produces a lot of brick (6 and 8 numbers), and they're building roads aggressively
   - SHEEP: Important for development cards, but I don't know if RED has many
   - WHEAT: Critical for settlements, cities, and development cards
   - ORE: I already have 3 ORE, so less valuable right now

2) Rolling the dice:
   - Would get me new resources based on my settlements
   - Production would be from wood (5,8), ore (10), wheat (4,12)
   - I'd likely get at least 1 resource to combine with my current ore

Strategic considerations:
- RED is building roads aggressively and has longest road (9 segments)
- I need to build up my own resource engine
- Monopoly is most valuable when an opponent has accumulated many of a specific resource
- RED's production is strong in brick, which fuels their road-building strategy

Looking at RED's settlements, they produce heavily from brick tiles (6 and 8). Given RED's focus on roads, they likely have accumulated brick, and claiming that would disrupt their road-building strategy while potentially giving me resources to build my own.

<plan>
1. Play monopoly on BRICK to disrupt RED's road-building strategy
2. Use acquired brick along with future resources to build roads toward the sheep port
3. Continue development card strategy when I have sheep/wheat/ore
4. Build more settlements to diversify my resource production
5. Work toward cities (priority on the wood/ore settlement)
</plan>

The optimal action is to use the monopoly card on brick, which would likely yield resources from RED while hindering their road-building strategy.

- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:

- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis: Robber Placement Strategy

I need to analyze the best place to move the robber based on the current game situation.

## Game State Assessment
- I (BLUE) have 2 VP from 2 settlements
- RED has 4 VP (2 from settlements + 2 from longest road)
- I have 1 WHEAT and 3 ORE in hand
- RED has 7 hidden cards
- RED has a massive road network (9 segments) and could be close to building more settlements

## Robber Placement Options
Let me analyze the key options:

1. Move to hexes with high-value production numbers that RED accesses:
   - (1, -1, 0): 🧱6 [⭐⭐⭐] - RED has two settlements on this brick hex
   - (2, -1, -1): 🧱8 [⭐⭐⭐] - RED has one settlement on this brick hex
   - (0, -1, 1): ⛏️10 [⭐] - Both RED and I have settlements on this ore hex

2. Consider RED's probable strategy:
   - RED has built many roads (9 segments) and likely needs BRICK to continue road building
   - RED may be aiming to build more settlements to secure more resources or reach 10 VP
   
3. My needs:
   - According to my plan, I need BRICK after playing my monopoly card
   - I need to disrupt RED's road building strategy

## Strategic Decision
Given that RED has two settlements on the BRICK-6 hex, this is their main source of brick for continuing their road-building strategy. Blocking this resource will significantly disrupt their plans while I prepare to play my monopoly card for brick.

The BRICK-6 hex at (1, -1, 0) is the most valuable target because:
1. It denies RED access to their primary brick source (two settlements touching this hex)
2. It allows me to potentially steal a brick card from RED
3. I don't have any settlements on this hex, so I'm not hurting my own production
4. This aligns with my plan to disrupt RED's road-building strategy

<plan>
1. Move robber to BRICK-6 hex to disrupt RED's road building
2. Play monopoly on BRICK when optimal timing presents itself
3. Use the acquired brick along with future resources to build roads toward the sheep port
4. Continue development card strategy when I have sheep/wheat/ore
5. Build settlements to diversify resource production
6. Work toward cities (priority on the wood/ore settlement)
</plan>

Therefore, I choose to move the robber to the BRICK-6 hex at (1, -1, 0), which is option 1.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze my current position and available actions:

## Current Position
- I have 2 VP from 2 settlements
- Resources: 1 wheat, 4 ore
- No development cards in hand (already played 1 monopoly)
- My settlements are well-positioned for ore production (at 10) and decent wood production
- The robber is on a brick-6 hex which affects RED

## Resources & Production
- I'm producing well in wood (8-5) and ore (10)
- I seem to be weaker in wheat, sheep, and brick production
- RED has longest road (+2 VP) and is ahead with 4 VP total

## Available Actions
0. End turn
1-4. Maritime trade options using my 4 ore to get wood, sheep, wheat, or brick

## Strategic Assessment

Given my current resources and the game state, I need to consider what my next build should be. The best options are:

1. Get wheat to complete an ore/wheat pair for a development card
2. Get brick to start building roads toward expansion
3. Get sheep to gather resources for a development card
4. Get wood to pair with my future brick for roads

My settlements produce wood well, so I don't need to trade for wood. I already have wheat, but only one, which isn't enough for meaningful builds. Brick would be strategically valuable for road expansion, particularly toward ports. Sheep would help with development card strategy.

Looking at my plan, I was planning to play monopoly on brick when optimal, but I've already played my monopoly card. I need to pivot my strategy.

<plan>
1. Trade for BRICK now to begin road expansion
2. Next, aim to build roads toward the sheep port
3. When I have sheep/wheat/ore, buy development cards
4. Place my next settlement near the sheep port or a location that diversifies my resource production
5. Work toward cities (priority on the wood/ore settlement)
</plan>

Given this updated strategy, trading my 4 ore for 1 brick makes the most sense. It aligns with my plan to expand with roads, and I already produce good ore.

- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

TURN 38 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Trade for BRICK now to begin road expansion
2. Next, aim to build roads toward the sheep port
3. When I have sheep/wheat/ore, buy development cards
4. Place my next settlement near the sheep port or a location that diversifies my resource production
5. Work toward cities (priority on the wood/ore settlement)

# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to decide where to place the robber to maximize my strategic position while hindering RED, who is ahead at 4 VP (including Longest Road bonus).

## Game State Analysis
- RED has 4 VP (2 settlements + 2 VP for Longest Road)
- I have 2 VP (2 settlements)
- RED has 5 hidden resource cards
- I have 1 BRICK and 1 WHEAT
- RED has settlements on nodes 2 and 7, producing from high-value hexes

## Resource Production Analysis
RED's settlements produce from:
- 🧱6 (on nodes 2 and 7) - very high probability brick
- 🐑4 (node 2) - low probability sheep
- ⛏️10 (node 2) - good probability ore
- 🌲9 (node 7) - decent probability wood
- 🧱8 (node 7) - good probability brick

RED clearly controls excellent brick production and has some ore access. With 10 roads built, RED is heavily invested in brick usage.

## Strategic Priorities
1. Block RED's most valuable resource production
2. Steal a useful resource if possible
3. Avoid blocking my own potential trades
4. Set myself up for my planned expansion

## Robber Placement Options

The most impactful options are:
- [0] Move to 🐑4 (0,0,0) - Low value target, affects RED
- [1] Move to ⛏️10 (0,-1,1) - High value, hits RED's ore production and one of my settlements
- [6] Move to 🌲9 (2,-2,0) - Medium value, hits RED's wood production
- [17] Move to 🧱8 (2,-1,-1) - High value, hits RED's brick production

Looking at RED's settlements, brick is clearly their strongest resource (two high-probability hexes). Since RED already has the Longest Road, their brick supply is vital for potential new settlements.

Option [17] targets 🧱8, which is a high-probability hex (8) producing brick for RED. This will:
1. Cut off a key resource for RED
2. Allow me to potentially steal a valuable resource
3. Not affect my own production

<plan>
1. Block RED's brick production by placing the robber on the 🧱8 hex
2. Continue saving for development cards when I have sheep/wheat/ore
3. Build roads toward the sheep port when I have wood/brick
4. Target my next settlement near the sheep port or other valuable resource spots
5. Focus on city upgrades once I have basic expansion established
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls

Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game situation and determine the best action.

## Game State Analysis

**Victory Points:**
- BLUE (me): 2 VPs (2 settlements)
- RED: 4 VPs (2 settlements + longest road bonus)

**Resources:**
- I have: 1 Wood, 1 Brick, 1 Sheep, 2 Wheat
- RED has 8 hidden resources

**Production Analysis:**
- My settlements produce from:
  * Settlement at node 10: Ore (10), Wood (5), Wood (8)
  * Settlement at node 12: Ore (10), Wheat (4), Wheat (12)
- RED's settlements produce from:
  * Settlement at node 2: Sheep (4), Brick (6), Ore (10)
  * Settlement at node 7: Brick (6), Wood (9), Brick (8)
- Note that RED has very strong brick production from two 6/8 brick hexes

**Available Actions:**
- End turn
- Build a road (8 different options)

**Development Card Strategy:**
I have insufficient resources to buy a development card (need Sheep+Wheat+Ore).

**Road Building Options:**
With 1 wood and 1 brick, I can build one road. Let's examine the strategic value of each option:

1. Road at edge (9, 10): Extends toward the brick port but doesn't lead to a viable settlement spot yet
2. Road at edge (13, 14): Extends east toward wheat/ore resources
3. Road at edge (10, 11): Extends west toward more wood resources
4. Road at edge (28, 29): Builds at the brick port - potential value but disconnected from my network
5. Road at edge (11, 12): Connects my two settlements - creates a loop but doesn't expand territory
6. Road at edge (3, 12): Extends south from settlement 12 toward sheep
7. Road at edge (13, 34): Extends southeast toward a 3:1 port
8. Road at edge (29, 30): Extends from node 29 but disconnected from my network

## Strategic Decision

My current resources allow me to build one road. Looking at development card strategy:
- I'm missing ore for a development card despite good production potential
- RED already has a significant lead with longest road
- I need to expand my network toward valuable nodes

Road option #2 (edge 13, 14) appears most strategic because:
1. It expands east toward high-value ore/wheat resources
2. It moves toward the wheat port (nodes 40, 44)
3. It's part of a path that could potentially block RED's expansion
4. There are good settlement spots in that direction with complementary resources

By building in that direction, I can:
- Access more ore production to fuel my development card strategy
- Build toward valuable 3:1 ports if I can't secure specific resource ports
- Position myself to potentially build a settlement at node 14 (Ore2, Wheat11, Wheat4)

<plan>
1. Build roads eastward toward ore/wheat resources and the wheat port
2. Focus on securing additional ore and wheat production for city upgrades and development cards
3. Build a settlement at node 14 if possible (Ore2, Wheat11, Wheat4)

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 46 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build roads eastward toward ore/wheat resources and the wheat port
2. Focus on securing additional ore and wheat production for city upgrades and development cards
3. Build a settlement at node 14 if possible (Ore2, Wheat11, Wheat4)
4. Continue development card strategy when resources allow to pursue largest army and victory points
5. Consider blocking RED's brick production when possible to slow their road building
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze the current game state and my options carefully:

## Current Game Status
- I (BLUE) have 2 victory points (2 settlements)
- RED has 4 victory points (2 settlements + longest road bonus)
- My resources: 1 sheep, 2 wheat, 2 ore
- I have 3 roads built with a longest road of 2 segments
- RED has 11 cards (hidden) and 11 roads built with longest road of 10 segments

## Available Actions
- [0] End turn
- [1] Buy a development card (cost: 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore)

## Resource Analysis
I can afford a development card with my current resources (1 sheep, 2 wheat, 2 ore), which would leave me with 1 wheat, 1 ore.

## Strategic Considerations

1. **Development Card Benefits**:
   - Could be a victory point card (immediate hidden VP)
   - Could be a knight (progress toward largest army - 2 VP)
   - Could be a progress card (Year of Plenty or Monopoly)
   
2. **RED Player Position**:
   - RED has 4 VP and 11 resource cards
   - RED already has longest road and will likely continue to build
   - RED has strong brick production (the robber is currently on one of RED's brick hexes)

3. **My Current Plan**:
   - Build roads eastward for expansion
   - Focus on ore/wheat for cities and development cards
   - Target settlement at node 14 (currently impossible with my resources)

Given my development card strategy for victory and RED's lead, the best option is to continue investing in development cards.

<plan>
1. Continue development card strategy to pursue largest army and victory points
2. Save remaining wheat/ore after buying development card for potential city upgrades
3. Target settlement at node 14 when resources allow
4. Consider using knights to move robber to RED's high-value hexes
5. Calculate path to largest army for 2VP bonus (need 3 knights minimum)
</plan>

Buying a development card follows my primary strategy and gives me the best chance at victory points, both through potential VP cards and working toward largest army.

# Game Analysis: BLUE's Turn

Let me carefully analyze my position and available options in this Settlers of Catan game.

## Current Game State Assessment:
- I have 2 VP from my 2 settlements
- RED has 5 VP (3 settlements + longest road bonus)
- I have 1 wheat, 3 ore, and 1 Knight development card
- The robber is on hex (2, -1, -1), which is a brick 8 hex that RED's settlement at node 7 is producing from

## Available Actions:
0. Play Knight card - Move the robber and steal a resource
1. Roll the dice

## Analysis of Options:

### Option 0: Play Knight Card
- Would allow me to move the robber from RED's valuable brick hex to another productive hex
- I could potentially steal a resource from RED
- Would give me 1 knight toward largest army (need 3 total)
- Protects me from potential resource loss if a 7 is rolled
- Prevents RED from gaining valuable brick resources for further road expansion

### Option 1: Roll the Dice
- Could generate new resources for me through my settlements
- Risky if I roll a 7 as I'll need to discard half my resources (though currently I only have 4)
- The robber would remain on RED's brick hex, continuing to block their production

## Strategic Considerations:

RED is ahead at 5 VP with longest road. They control brick production, which is critical for their road-building strategy. By playing my knight, I can:
1. Disrupt RED's resource engine by moving the robber to another of their productive hexes
2. Begin my path toward largest army (2 VP bonus)
3. Potentially steal a useful resource from RED

My development card strategy relies on accumulating knights for largest army, and this is a good opportunity to start that process while disrupting RED.

<plan>
1. Play Knight card to move robber to RED's high-value hex (likely the wheat 6 at (-1, 1, 0) that their settlement at node 4 produces from)
2. Continue development card strategy to pursue largest army
3. Save my wheat/ore for buying another development card or city upgrade
4. Target settlement at node 14 when resources allow
5. Need 2 more knights to gain largest army bonus (2 VP)
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I should play my Knight card now to begin pursuing the largest army and disrupt RED's resource production.

- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

❓ Select action by number (0-17):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I need to analyze where to place the robber to maximize my strategic advantage against RED, who has 5 victory points and is currently ahead.

Let's examine RED's settlements and their resource production:
1. Node 2: Sheep 4, Brick 6, Ore 10
2. Node 7: Brick 6, Wood 9, Brick 8
3. Node 4: Sheep 4, Wheat 4, Wheat 6

Let's prioritize based on:
- High production value (6s and 8s)
- Resources RED might need for further expansion
- Resources I might want to deny them

Looking at the numbers with probability stars:
- Brick 6 (⭐⭐⭐) is produced at nodes 2 and 7
- Brick 8 (⭐⭐⭐) is produced at node 7
- Wheat 6 (⭐⭐⭐) is produced at node 4
- Wood 9 (⭐⭐) is produced at node 7

I notice that RED has 11 roads built with the longest road bonus, meaning they're investing in brick and wood. Node 7 produces two valuable brick resources (6 and 8), which would be excellent to block.

The Wheat 6 hex at (-1, 1, 0) is also highly valuable, as wheat is critical for settlements and development cards.

Let's check the available options:
- Option [1]: Move robber to (1, -1, 0) - This is a Brick 6 hex
- Option [4]: Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) - This is a Wheat 6 hex
- Option [7]: Move robber to (2, -2, 0) - This is a Wood 9 hex

Option [1] would block a high-probability brick resource that RED relies on for road building.
Option [4] would block a high-probability wheat resource that RED needs for expansion.

RED has the longest road bonus and would likely continue expanding their road network, so denying brick is strategically important. However, RED has multiple sources of brick from two different hexes.

Meanwhile, the Wheat 6 hex appears to be RED's only high-probability wheat source, which they'd need for both settlements and development cards. Since my strategy involves getting ahead in development cards for largest army, denying RED access to wheat seems most valuable.

<plan>
1. Move robber to the Wheat 6 hex at (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED
2. Continue development card strategy to pursue largest army
3. Save wheat/ore for buying another development card or city upgrade
4. Target settlement at node 14 when resources allow
5. Need 2 more knights to gain largest army bonus (2 VP)
</plan>

Therefore, I'll choose option [4] to move the robber to the Wheat 6 hex at (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights

RESPONSE:
# Analyzing the Game State:

I need to carefully evaluate the current situation to determine the optimal move.

## Current Position:
- I have 2 victory points (2 settlements)
- RED has 5 victory points (3 settlements + longest road bonus)
- Resources: 1 🧱BRICK, 2 🌾WHEAT, 3 ⛏️ORE
- I've played 1 knight and 1 monopoly card
- The robber is on a Wheat 6 hex, limiting production
- I have enough resources to build a city

## Resource Production Analysis:
- Settlement at node 10: ⛏️10[⭐], 🌲5[⭐⭐], 🌲8[⭐⭐⭐] - good wood production, some ore
- Settlement at node 12: ⛏️10[⭐], 🌾4[⭐], 🌾12 - some ore and wheat, but 12 is rare

## Victory Path Assessment:
My current plan focuses on development cards/largest army, but I have limited sheep production. A city upgrade will double resource production and give me +1 VP.

## City Upgrade Options:
1. Node 10 (produces ore and wood): Would boost wood and ore production
2. Node 12 (produces ore and wheat): Would boost resources needed for development cards

## Strategic Decision:
Upgrading to a city is an optimal move as it:
- Gives me an immediate +1 VP (closing the gap with RED)
- Doubles resource production at a critical location
- Gets me to 3 VP total (from current 2 VP)
- Follows the development card strategy by improving ore/wheat production for future purchases

Node 12 is the better choice for city upgrade because:
- It produces both ore and wheat, which are critical for development cards
- These are exactly the resources needed for my development card strategy
- Better to double ore/wheat production than wood production given my path to victory

<plan>
1. Upgrade settlement at node 12 to city to double ore/wheat production
2. Continue development card strategy to pursue largest army
3. Save next resources for development cards (need sheep)
4. Look for opportunities to acquire sheep through trading
5. Still need 2 more knights to gain largest army bonus
</plan>

- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 50 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Upgrade settlement at node 12 to city to double ore/wheat production
2. Continue development card strategy to pursue largest army
3. Save next resources for development cards (need sheep)
4. Look for opportunities to acquire sheep through trading
5. Still need 2 more knights to gain largest army bonus

❓ Select action by number (0-9):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state step by step to determine the optimal action.

**Current Game Analysis:**
- I have 3 VP (1 settlement + 1 city + 0 bonuses)
- RED has 5 VP (3 settlements + 0 cities + 2 VP from Longest Road)
- I have 2 wood and 1 brick (enough to build a road)
- I've already played 1 Knight card and 1 Monopoly card
- My current plan focuses on upgrading to cities and pursuing development cards for Largest Army

**Resource Assessment:**
- I have enough resources to build exactly 1 road
- I don't have enough resources for any other builds (settlements, cities, or development cards)
- RED has 6 hidden resources and is leading at 5 VP

**Strategic Options:**
1. End my turn (conserve resources)
2. Build a road to position for future expansion

**Building a Road Analysis:**
Since I can build a road, I should evaluate whether doing so is worthwhile versus saving resources. I need to consider:
- Which road placement improves my position strategically?
- How does this advance my path to victory?
- Does building a road now enable me to pursue my development card strategy?

Looking at the road options, I notice several possibilities:
- Roads (9, 10), (10, 11), or (11, 12) would expand westward from my settlement at node 10
- Road (14, 15) would expand eastward from my road at (13, 14)
- Road (13, 34) would expand toward the wheat port

The most strategic roads would be ones that:
1. Lead toward valuable future settlement spots with good resource production
2. Help block RED's expansion
3. Lead toward important ports matching my resource generation

Given my current plan focuses on development cards (requiring sheep, wheat, and ore), I should prioritize positioning myself to get more of these resources.

**Decision Analysis:**
Since I've previously committed to a development card strategy, I need sheep (which I'm lacking). Building a road now would deplete my resources without directly advancing my development card strategy.

Looking at my existing settlements/cities, I already have strong production of wood (8, 5), ore (10), and wheat (12, 4). I'm missing reliable sheep production.

Without a clear path to a high-value settlement location that would provide sheep, and with limited resources that could be better saved for development cards once I acquire sheep, the most strategic move is to end my turn and wait for better resource combinations.

<plan>
1. End turn to conserve resources
2. Focus on acquiring sheep through dice rolls or trading
3. Continue development card strategy to pursue largest army (need 2 more knights)
4. Once I have sheep/wheat/ore, buy development cards
5. Next build should be city upgrades when resources permit
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road

- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points

RESPONSE:
# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to choose where to place the robber strategically to maximize my advantage and hinder my opponent who is ahead with 5/10 victory points (with longest road) versus my 3/10 points.

## Game State Assessment
- RED is leading with 5 VP (3 settlements + 2 VP from longest road)
- I have 3 VP (1 settlement + 1 city)
- RED has a significant road network (10 segments) that gives them the longest road bonus
- I need to continue my development card strategy to build toward largest army

## Robber Placement Priorities
1. Block RED's high-probability resource production
2. Target resources RED needs for continued expansion
3. Potentially steal a valuable resource from RED
4. Ideally, minimize disruption to my own resource generation

## Analyzing Key Options

Looking at RED's settlements:
- Node 2: produces 🐑4, 🧱6[⭐⭐⭐], ⛏️10[⭐]
- Node 7: produces 🧱6[⭐⭐⭐], 🌲9[⭐⭐], 🧱8[⭐⭐⭐]
- Node 4: produces 🐑4[⭐], 🌾4[⭐], 🌾6[⭐⭐⭐]

The best targets are:
- Option [1] (1, -1, 0): Blocks 🧱6[⭐⭐⭐] which supplies RED's nodes 2 and 7. This is a high-value brick hex that RED relies heavily on.
- Option [17] (2, -1, -1): Blocks 🧱8[⭐⭐⭐] which supplies RED's node 7
- Option [3] (-1, 0, 1): Blocks 🌾6[⭐⭐⭐] which supplies RED's node 4

Option [1] is particularly powerful because:
1. It blocks RED's access to brick (6) which is crucial for road building
2. This hex supplies two of RED's settlements, maximizing impact
3. RED has the longest road bonus and will likely want to extend it further
4. I don't need brick immediately for my development card strategy
5. I can potentially steal a valuable resource from RED

While option [3] blocks wheat which RED needs, and option [17] blocks another brick source, option [1] impacts RED's strategy more significantly by cutting off the most productive brick hex that feeds multiple settlements.

<plan>
1. Block RED's brick production by placing robber on (1, -1, 0)
2. Focus on acquiring sheep through dice rolls or trading
3. Continue development card strategy to pursue largest army (need 2 more knights)
4. Once I have sheep/wheat/ore, buy development cards
5. Next build should be city upgrades when resources permit
</plan>

You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 52 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Block RED's brick production by placing robber on (1, -1, 0)
2. Focus on acquiring sheep through dice rolls or trading
3. Continue development card strategy to pursue largest army (need 2 more knights)
4. Once I have sheep/wheat/ore, buy development cards
5. Next build should be city upgrades when resources permit
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.
  To adjust your plan, provide a NEW PLAN in your reasoning with <plan>your new plan</plan>

❓ Select action by number (0-9):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action.

## Game State Analysis:
- Current points: BLUE has 3 VP (1 settlement + 1 city + 1 played knight)
- RED has 5 VP (3 settlements + 2 VP for longest road)
- Resources: 3 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK, 1 🌾WHEAT
- The robber is already on RED's brick production hex (1, -1, 0)
- No development cards in hand
- Current plan focuses on blocking RED's brick production (already done) and pursuing largest army

## Options Assessment:
1. End Turn (Option 0): This would waste our current resources and opportunity to build.
2. Build Road (Options 1-9): We have exactly enough resources (1 wood, 1 brick) to build one road.

## Road Building Strategic Analysis:
- Building a road doesn't directly increase VP but could:
  1. Lead to valuable future settlement spots
  2. Work toward longest road (though RED has 10 segments, we only have 3)
  3. Block RED's expansion

Let me analyze the best road placements:
- Option 3 (28, 29): This road would connect to a 2:1 brick port, which could be valuable since we're near wood hexes
- Option 2 (10, 11): Expands toward both ore and wood resources
- Option 5 (14, 37): Expands toward a 3:1 port
- Option 8 (13, 34): Expands toward a 3:1 port and wheat hex

Since our current plan emphasizes development cards for largest army, we need to focus on getting ore, wheat, and sheep. The best road would be one that helps us secure those resources.

Looking at the map, option 2 (10, 11) seems most strategic as it expands toward the ore hex (⛏️10) which we need for our development card strategy. This also builds toward potential future settlement locations with better access to ore.

## Updated Strategic Plan:
<plan>
1. Build road at (10, 11) to expand toward ore production
2. Focus on acquiring sheep through dice rolls or trading
3. Continue development card strategy to pursue largest army (need 2 more knights)
4. Once I have sheep/wheat/ore, buy development cards
5. Next build should be city upgrades or strategic settlements when resources permit
</plan>

Therefore, I choose to build a road at edge (10, 11):

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and available options:

## Current Game Status
- **Me (BLUE)**: 3 VP (1 settlement + 1 city + 1 knight)
- **RED**: 5 VP (3 settlements + 2 VP for longest road)
- **My Resources**: 4 Wood, 1 Wheat, 3 Ore
- **RED's Resources**: 4 hidden cards

## Resource Analysis
I have decent wood and ore production but limited wheat (only one source that's a 4 and 12). My major weakness is no sheep production at all, which is critical for development cards.

## Strategic Considerations
1. I need to continue the development card strategy (per my plan)
2. I need sheep for this strategy to work
3. RED is ahead by 2 points with longest road and more settlements

## Available Actions
- End turn [0]
- Trade 4 wood for various resources [1-4]

## Decision Making Process

Looking at my options:
- I have 4 wood, which I can trade for a sheep (which I desperately need)
- A development card costs 1 sheep + 1 wheat + 1 ore
- I currently have 1 wheat and 3 ore, so with a sheep I'd have all resources needed to buy a development card on my next turn

The most pressing need is sheep since I have no sheep production. Trading my 4 wood for 1 sheep would allow me to pursue my development card strategy. This aligns with my current plan of focusing on development cards to get largest army and potentially hidden victory points.

<plan>
1. Trade 4 wood for 1 sheep
2. On next turn, use 1 sheep + 1 wheat + 1 ore to buy a development card
3. Continue development card strategy to pursue largest army (need 2 more knights)
4. Look to upgrade my settlement to a city when resources permit
5. Consider roads to expand toward sheep production when possible
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I should trade my wood for sheep:

4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 56 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Trade 4 wood for 1 sheep
2. On next turn, use 1 sheep + 1 wheat + 1 ore to buy a development card
3. Continue development card strategy to pursue largest army (need 2 more knights)
4. Look to upgrade my settlement to a city when resources permit
5. Consider roads to expand toward sheep production when possible
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

❓ Select action by number (0-1):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state and available actions to make the optimal decision.

## Game State Analysis:
- I currently have 3 victory points (1 settlement + 1 city)
- My opponent (RED) has 5 victory points (3 settlements + longest road bonus)
- My resources: 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 3 ore
- I have previously played 1 knight and 1 monopoly card
- The robber is on a brick hex (1, -1, 0) with value 6
- I have strong wood production (5, 8) but currently low on wood resources
- I have a good city location on node 12 producing ore and wheat
- Available options: [0] End turn or [1] Buy development card

## Decision Reasoning:

According to my current plan, I was going to trade 4 wood for 1 sheep and then buy a development card next turn. However, I don't currently have any wood to trade, so that part of the plan is not executable.

Looking at my resources, I have exactly what I need to buy a development card right now (1 sheep + 1 wheat + 1 ore). This aligns with my development card strategy, which is my primary path to victory.

Buying a development card could give me:
1. A victory point card (immediate hidden VP)
2. A knight (advancing toward largest army - need 2 more)
3. A monopoly or year of plenty card (useful utility)

RED already has 5 VP and longest road, so they're halfway to victory. I need to accelerate my strategy.

I have enough ore remaining (2) to start working toward my next city upgrade when I get more wheat. Since development cards are hidden information, buying one now keeps my opponent guessing about my strategy and potential victory points.

<plan>
1. Buy a development card now (1 sheep + 1 wheat + 1 ore)
2. If I get a knight, save it to protect my high-production hexes or move toward largest army
3. If I get a victory point card, keep it hidden until I can win in a single turn
4. Next turns: focus on gathering wheat and ore to upgrade to another city
5. Consider expanding toward the sheep port (nodes 25, 26) when resources permit
</plan>

The optimal action is clear: I should buy a development card to advance my winning strategy.

# Game State Analysis

Let me carefully analyze the current game state to make the optimal decision:

## Current Situation
- I have 3 victory points (1 from settlement + 2 from city)
- Opponent has 5 victory points (3 from settlements + 2 from longest road)
- I have 1 ore resource and 1 knight development card
- The robber is currently on the wheat hex (-1, -1, 2) which is producing on a 12 - a very low probability
- I would normally roll the dice to collect resources, but I have a knight card available

## Resources and Production
My production is focused on:
- Strong wood production (numbers 5 and 8)
- Decent ore production (number 10)
- Some wheat production (numbers 4 and 12, with 12 currently blocked)
- Currently no brick or sheep production

## Knight Card Considerations
1. Playing the knight would:
   - Allow me to move the robber from my wheat hex (though it's only a 12, very low probability)
   - Let me place the robber on one of the opponent's productive hexes
   - Give me a resource from the opponent
   - Move me closer to the largest army bonus (2 VP)

2. If I save the knight:
   - I can use it later when the robber is placed on one of my better production hexes
   - I'll keep my progress toward largest army

## Decision Factors
- The robber is currently on my wheat hex, but it's a 12 (very low probability of 1/36)
- I would gain more benefit from playing the knight if the robber was blocking one of my better hexes
- Rolling dice would likely give me resources needed for my next moves
- The opponent has 5 resources I could potentially steal

<plan>
1. Roll dice to gather resources this turn
2. Save the knight card for when:
   a) The robber blocks one of my high-production hexes (5, 8, 10)
   b) I need to steal a specific resource from my opponent to complete a build
   c) I'm ready to push for largest army bonus (after getting another knight)
3. Focus on buying development cards to get more knights and hidden victory points
4. Work toward upgrading my settlement to a city (need 3 ore, 2 wheat)
5. Look to expand toward the sheep port (nodes 25, 26) when possible
</plan>

After analyzing all options, I believe it's best to roll the dice this turn. The robber is on a low-probability hex (12), so it's not significantly impacting my production. I'll save the knight for when the robber blocks a more valuable hex or when I'm closer to getting the largest army bonus.

- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:

- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 58 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Roll dice to gather resources this turn
2. Save the knight card for when:
   a) The robber blocks one of my high-production hexes (5, 8, 10)
   b) I need to steal a specific resource from my opponent to complete a build
   c) I'm ready to push for largest army bonus (after getting another knight)
3. Focus on buying development cards to get more knights and hidden victory points
4. Work toward upgrading my settlement to a city (need 3 ore, 2 wheat)
5. Look to expand toward the sheep port (nodes 25, 26) when possible
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state:

**Current Victory Points:**
- BLUE (me): 3/10 VP (1 settlement, 1 city, possibly hiding victory point cards)
- RED: 5/10 VP (3 settlements, longest road bonus)

**My Resources:**
- 1 WOOD
- 1 ORE
- 1 KNIGHT card

**Game Situation:**
- The robber is currently on a wheat hex (-1, -1, 2) with a 12 production number
- This is a low-probability hex (2.78% chance) so its impact is minimal
- RED has 6 hidden resource cards

## Action Analysis

I have two options:
1. **Play Knight card (Option 0)**: Move the robber and steal a resource from RED
2. **End Turn (Option 1)**: Save the knight card for later

### Option 0: Play Knight

If I play the knight:
- I can move the robber to a high-value hex for RED (like the 6 or 8 brick hexes)
- I can steal one of RED's 6 resource cards
- This brings me closer to largest army (I'd have 2 knights played)
- But I'd use my only defensive knight card

### Option 1: End Turn

If I end my turn:
- I preserve my knight card for when:
  - The robber gets placed on one of my valuable production hexes
  - I need a specific resource for a crucial build
  - I can combine it with more knights for largest army
- I maintain defensive capability

## Strategic Reasoning

Looking at my current strategy:
- I'm focusing on development cards and city building
- I have very few resources right now (just 1 wood, 1 ore)
- The robber is not blocking any of my high-value hexes
- I need to gather resources before making a major move

According to my plan, I should save the knight for when:
1. The robber blocks one of my high-production hexes
2. I need to steal a specific resource to complete a build
3. I'm ready to push for largest army

None of these conditions are currently met. The robber is on a low-probability wheat hex, I don't have enough resources for any meaningful build, and I'm still far from largest army.

<plan>
1. Save the knight card for when it's truly valuable (robber on my high-value hexes or when I'm close to a build)
2. Continue gathering resources to purchase more development cards
3. Work toward upgrading my settlement to a city (need 3 ore, 2 wheat)
4. Look to expand toward the sheep port (nodes 25, 26) when possible
5. Consider the largest army bonus once I get more knight cards
</plan>

Given these considerations, the optimal move is to end my turn and save the knight for a more strategic moment.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and my options:

## Current Standings:
- I (BLUE): 3/10 VP (1 settlement + 1 city)
- RED: 5/10 VP (3 settlements + longest road bonus)

## My Resources:
- 1 🌲 Wood
- 4 ⛏️ Ore
- 1 Knight development card in hand

## Available Actions:
- [0] Play Knight card - Move the robber and steal a resource
- [1] Roll the dice

## Strategic Considerations:

1. **Knight Card Value**: 
   - Playing the knight now would let me move the robber from the wheat hex and potentially steal a useful resource from RED
   - But I should save knights for more strategic situations (when robber is on my high-value hexes)
   - Playing knights contributes to largest army (2 VP bonus), but I only have 1 played so far

2. **Resource Analysis**:
   - I need more ore (3) and wheat (2) to upgrade my settlement to a city
   - I currently have 4 ore but no wheat
   - The robber is currently on a wheat hex (-1, -1, 2) which is blocking my city's production

3. **Risk Assessment**:
   - RED has 7 cards - they're "safe" from a 7 roll right now
   - If I roll a 7, I can move the robber anyway

4. **Opportunity Cost**:
   - Playing the knight now means I won't have it for emergencies later
   - If I roll well, I could potentially build something this turn

The robber is currently on my wheat hex, which impacts my city's production. Moving it would be valuable, especially since I need wheat for both city upgrades and development cards. Additionally, stealing a card from RED (who has 7 cards) could give me a resource I need.

<plan>
1. Play the knight card now to move the robber off my wheat hex
2. Place the robber on one of RED's valuable resource hexes (brick 6 or wood 9)
3. Continue gathering resources to upgrade my settlement to a city (need 2 wheat)
4. Look to expand toward the sheep port (nodes 25, 26) when possible
5. Work toward largest army bonus (need 1 more knight)
</plan>

After careful consideration, I believe playing the knight card is the optimal move. It will remove the robber from my wheat hex, allowing me to potentially get wheat on future rolls, and I can steal a resource from RED which might help me build sooner.

- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

RESPONSE:
# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to move the robber from the wheat (12) hex at (-1,-1,2) which is currently blocking my city at node 12.

Let me analyze the best location to place the robber strategically:

## Current Game State
- I'm BLUE with 3 VP (1 settlement + 1 city)
- RED has 5 VP (3 settlements + longest road bonus)
- RED has 7 resource cards (at risk of losing half if a 7 is rolled)
- I have 1 wood and 4 ore resources currently

## Robber Placement Priorities
1. Disrupt RED's highest-producing hexes
2. Target resources RED needs for their strategy
3. Steal a valuable resource from RED

Looking at RED's settlements:
- Node 2: on 🐑4, 🧱6, ⛏️10 
- Node 7: on 🧱6, 🌲9, 🧱8
- Node 4: on 🐑4, 🌾4, 🌾6

The high-value hexes for RED are:
- 🧱6 at (1,-1,0) - produces for TWO settlements (nodes 2 and 7) and is a strong resource
- 🧱8 at (2,-1,-1) - high probability brick for RED
- 🌾6 at (-1,1,0) - high probability wheat for RED

## Best Robber Placement Options

Option 1 (action #1): Move robber to 🧱6 at (1,-1,0)
- This blocks RED's most productive hex (brick 6)
- This hex produces for TWO of RED's settlements
- Will steal a resource from RED

Option 17 (action #17): Move robber to 🧱8 at (2,-1,-1)
- Blocks another high-value brick hex for RED
- Will steal a resource from RED

Option 4 (action #4): Move robber to 🌾6 at (-1,1,0)
- Blocks RED's wheat production (critical for development cards and cities)
- Will steal a resource from RED

## Strategic Decision

Option #1 is clearly optimal because:
1. It blocks a 6 (high probability) resource
2. It affects TWO of RED's settlements simultaneously
3. Brick is crucial for RED's road-building strategy (they already have longest road)
4. Stealing from RED gives me additional resources
5. RED has 7 cards so there's a good chance to steal something valuable

<plan>
1. Move the robber to RED's brick 6 hex to disrupt their road building
2. Use my ore to purchase development cards (hoping for knights or VP cards)
3. When I get wheat, upgrade my settlement to a city
4. Aim to get largest army (need 1 more knight)
5. Look for opportunities to expand toward the sheep port
</plan>

\boxed{1}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

❓ Select action by number (0-4):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state and available options thoroughly to determine the best strategic move.

## Current Situation Assessment
- I have 3 VP currently (1 settlement, 1 city)
- Red has 5 VP (3 settlements + 2 VP from Longest Road)
- I have 1 wood, 1 sheep, 4 ore
- I need 1 more knight to potentially get Largest Army (+2 VP)
- The robber is on the brick 6 hex (1, -1, 0), blocking a key Red production hex
- Development cards remaining: 22

## Resource Analysis
My 4 ore is my most valuable asset right now. I can:
1. Trade 4 ore for another resource through 4:1 trading
2. Save the ore for city upgrades or development cards when I get wheat

## Strategic Options

**Option 0: End Turn**
- Pros: Preserve my 4 ore for future development card or city upgrade
- Cons: Not utilizing my current resources, potentially missing opportunities

**Options 1-4: Maritime Trade**
- Trading 4 ore for 1 of another resource is extremely inefficient
- I'd need wheat to build a development card (ore+wheat+sheep) or city upgrade (ore+ore+wheat)
- But trading at 4:1 ratio is very costly when ore is so valuable

## Current Plan Review
My current plan involves:
1. Disrupting Red with the robber (already achieved)
2. Using ore for development cards (need wheat)
3. Upgrading settlement to city (need more ore and wheat)
4. Getting largest army (need 1 more knight)
5. Expanding toward sheep port

Given my current resources, I can't immediately execute any part of this plan without first getting wheat.

## Decision Process
- I need wheat above all else right now, but trading 4 ore for 1 wheat is a terrible exchange rate
- My core strategy revolves around development cards for hidden VPs and largest army
- Red is at 5 VP and has more visible infrastructure, making them a threat
- Holding my resources makes the most sense until I can make a more efficient play

<plan>
1. End my turn and wait to collect more resources naturally
2. Keep the robber on Red's brick 6 hex to slow their road building
3. When I get wheat, buy a development card (hoping for knight or VP)
4. Save ore for city upgrades and development cards
5. If I get largest army, I'll be at 5 VP (on par with Red)
6. Look for opportunities to break Red's longest road when possible
</plan>

Given these considerations, the most strategic move is to end my turn and collect more resources on future rolls, preserving my valuable ore.

- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 62 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. End my turn and wait to collect more resources naturally
2. Keep the robber on Red's brick 6 hex to slow their road building
3. When I get wheat, buy a development card (hoping for knight or VP)
4. Save ore for city upgrades and development cards
5. If I get largest army, I'll be at 5 VP (on par with Red)
6. Look for opportunities to break Red's longest road when possible
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game situation and available options:

**Current Victory Points**:
- BLUE (me): 3 VP (1 settlement + 1 city + 0 bonus)
- RED: 5 VP (3 settlements + 0 cities + 2 VP for longest road)

**Resources**:
- I have: 1 wood, 1 sheep, 2 wheat, 4 ore
- RED has 10 cards (hidden)

**Board Position**:
- RED has longest road (10 segments)
- Robber is on RED's brick 6 hex (good for us)
- I have played 2 knights (need 1 more for largest army)

## Available Actions Analysis

[0] End Turn - This would waste resources and my turn with no progress.

[1] Upgrade settlement at node 10 to city - This would cost 2 wheat + 3 ore, giving me +1 VP and increasing my production of wood (5,8) and ore (10).

[2] Buy development card - Costs 1 sheep + 1 wheat + 1 ore. Could give me a knight (for largest army), VP card, or useful action card.

[3-6] Maritime trades - All poor value at 4:1 ratio and don't enable any better actions.

## Decision Making

**Option 1: Upgrade to City**
- Benefits: +1 VP (reaching 4 VP), improved production
- Drawbacks: Uses most of my resources, leaving me with 1 wood, 1 sheep, 1 ore
- Long-term: Better production helps future turns, but still far behind RED

**Option 2: Buy Development Card**
- Benefits: Potential knight (largest army = 2 VP), VP card, or action card
- Drawbacks: Uncertain outcome, might not help immediately
- Long-term: Could be path to victory if I get knights/VP cards

Looking at paths to victory:
- If I go for city, I gain 1 VP (to 4 VP) but have limited resources left
- If I get development card and it's a knight, I need one more for largest army (2 VP)
- Development cards offer a "hidden strength" advantage

RED is ahead at 5 VP with longest road. Breaking their longest road later + building my own strength is my best strategy.

<plan>
1. Buy development card now hoping for knight or VP
2. Continue collecting resources next turn
3. If I get a knight, play it to move toward largest army (2 VP)
4. Next priorities: upgrade settlement to city (+1 VP) and buy more development cards
5. Aim for victory through cities (4 VP) + settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + VP cards (2+ VP)
</plan>

Given that RED is ahead with 5 VP, and development cards offer the best chance at catching up through largest army or hidden VP cards, I'll buy a development card.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

# Analyzing the Game State

Let me analyze the current game situation to determine my best move:

## Current Points
- I (BLUE) have 3 VP (1 settlement + 1 city + 0 bonus)
- RED has 6 VP (4 settlements + 0 cities + 2 VP for longest road)

## Resources
- I have 2 Wood, 1 Wheat, 3 Ore
- I already have 1 Knight card unplayed + 2 Knights already played

## Options
1. Play Knight card (option 0): This would:
   - Move the robber from the brick hex (1, -1, 0) to block an opponent resource
   - Let me steal a card from RED
   - Get me to 3 played knights, securing Largest Army (2 VP)

2. Roll dice (option 1): Standard turn progression, but I risk:
   - Rolling a 7 with only 6 cards (safe)
   - Not being able to achieve a major objective this turn

## Strategic Analysis

The robber is currently on a Brick hex (🧱6) with a high roll probability. This is hurting RED who has two settlements producing from it (nodes 2 and 7). RED is already ahead with 6 VP, and they have the Longest Road.

If I play my Knight card:
- I'll move to 3 Knights played, securing the Largest Army bonus (2 VP)
- This immediately boosts me from 3 VP to 5 VP
- I can potentially steal a useful resource from RED
- I can block one of RED's productive hexes

Given that RED is already at 6 VP and has Longest Road, I need to catch up quickly. Getting Largest Army right now provides an immediate 2-point swing and puts me back in contention.

<plan>
1. Play Knight card now to secure Largest Army (2 VP) 
2. Move robber to block RED's most productive hex
3. Next turns: Prioritize upgrading settlement to city (+1 VP)
4. Look for opportunities to buy development cards for potential VP cards
5. New path to victory: cities (4 VP) + settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + potential VP cards (2+ VP)
</plan>

The best strategic move is clearly to play my Knight card to secure Largest Army immediately.

- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

❓ Select action by number (0-17):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I need to analyze the current game state and decide where to move the robber to maximize my chances of winning. Let me think through this step by step:

**Current Game Analysis:**
- I'm BLUE with 5 VP (2 from Largest Army, 1 from settlement, 2 from city)
- RED has 6 VP (2 from Longest Road, 4 from settlements)
- I have 2 wood, 1 wheat, 3 ore in my hand
- RED is ahead by 1 VP, so I need to slow them down while advancing my own position
- RED has 6 hidden resource cards I could steal from

**Robber Placement Strategy:**
I need to evaluate where placing the robber will have the most impact:

1. Priority targets should be RED's high-value production nodes
2. I should target resources that RED needs for their next likely build
3. I should avoid blocking resources I might need myself

**RED's Settlements and Production:**
- Node 2: produces 🐑4, 🧱6 (high value), ⛏️10 (high value)
- Node 7: produces 🧱6 (high value), 🌲9, 🧱8 (high value)
- Node 4: produces 🐑4, 🌾4, 🌾6 (high value)
- Node 23: produces ⛏️11, 🐑3, 🧱8 (high value)

RED has excellent brick production (multiple 6 and 8 values). They also have good ore access. Since they already have longest road, they're likely looking to build cities next, which requires ore and wheat.

**Best Robber Placement Options:**
- Option [1]: Move to (0, -1, 1) - blocks ⛏️10 which hurts both RED and me
- Option [3]: Move to (-1, 1, 0) - blocks 🌾6, hurting RED's wheat production (needed for cities)
- Option [5]: Move to (1, 0, -1) - blocks ⛏️11, hurting RED's ore production (needed for cities)
- Option [17]: Move to (2, -1, -1) - blocks 🧱8, hurting RED's brick production

Looking at RED's likely strategy, they have 6 VP and need 4 more. They likely want to upgrade settlements to cities. Since they need ore and wheat for cities, blocking one of those resources would be most impactful.

Option [3] targets the wheat hex (6) that produces for RED's settlement at node 4. This is a high-probability number and wheat is critical for cities.

Option [5] targets the ore hex (11) that produces for RED's settlement at node 23. Ore is also critical for cities.

Given that RED has 4 settlements and likely wants to upgrade to cities, blocking their ore or wheat is most strategic. Since the ore hex is a slightly higher probability (11 vs 6), and ore is more exclusively needed for cities:

<plan>
1. Move robber to ore hex (1, 0, -1) to block RED's ore production and steal a card
2. Next turn, prioritize using my 3 ore to upgrade my settlement to city (+1 VP)
3. Continue buying development cards when possible for potential VP cards
4. Path to victory: cities (4 VP) + settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + potential VP cards (2+ VP)
</plan>

I'll select option [5] to move the robber to the ore hex at (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and available actions:

## Victory Points Situation
- I (BLUE) have 5/10 VPs: 1 settlement (1 VP), 1 city (2 VP), and largest army (2 VP)
- RED has 6/10 VPs: 4 settlements (4 VP) and longest road (2 VP)
- RED is ahead by 1 VP and has strong board position with 4 settlements

## My Resources
- 2 🌲WOOD
- 1 🌾WHEAT
- 4 ⛏️ORE

## Available Actions
- End turn [0]
- Maritime trade options using 4 ore [1-4]

## Strategic Considerations

First, I need to evaluate what I can do with my current resources:
- I don't have enough resources to build anything directly (settlement = 1🌲1🧱1🐑1🌾, city = 3⛏️2🌾, dev card = 1⛏️1🐑1🌾)
- I need 1 more wheat to build a city (costs 3 ore + 2 wheat)
- I have 4 ore, which is enough to make a maritime trade

Looking at my path to victory:
- I need 5 more VPs to win
- Converting a settlement to city gives +1 VP (need 3⛏️2🌾)
- New settlement gives +1 VP (need 1🌲1🧱1🐑1🌾)
- Development card might give VP or knight (for security)

The most efficient next step would be to upgrade my settlement to a city, which requires 1 more wheat. I can trade 4 ore for 1 wheat, then on my next turn, I'll have 3⛏️2🌾 needed for a city upgrade.

<plan>
1. Trade 4 ore for 1 wheat using maritime trade
2. Next turn, use my 3 ore and 2 wheat to upgrade settlement to city (+1 VP)
3. Continue buying development cards when possible for potential VP cards
4. Path to victory: cities (4 VP) + settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + potential VP cards (2+ VP)
</plan>

Since I already have the largest army bonus, securing more VPs through city upgrades is my best path. Trading 4 ore for 1 wheat (action 3) lets me immediately prepare for a city upgrade on my next turn.

Therefore, the optimal action is:

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me carefully analyze the current game state and available options:

## Current Game Status
- I (BLUE) have 5/10 victory points (1 settlement, 1 city, largest army bonus)
- RED has 7/10 victory points (3 settlements, 1 city, longest road bonus)
- My resources: 2 Wood, 4 Wheat
- No development cards in hand

## Current Plan Review
My current plan involves:
1. Trading 4 ore for 1 wheat via maritime trade
2. Upgrading a settlement to a city
3. Buying development cards when possible

However, this plan seems outdated because:
- I don't have 4 ore to trade for wheat (I have 4 wheat already)
- I need ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities (3 ore, 2 wheat)
- I currently don't have any ore at all to make progress toward city building

## Options Analysis
Given my current resources (2 Wood, 4 Wheat), I can:
1. Trade 4 wheat for 1 wood (not helpful)
2. Trade 4 wheat for 1 sheep (could help toward development card)
3. Trade 4 wheat for 1 ore (helps toward city upgrade)
4. Trade 4 wheat for 1 brick (helps toward settlement expansion)
5. End my turn [0]

RED is at 7 VP and ahead of me. I need to accelerate my point acquisition.

## Strategic Considerations

Looking at available actions, I can trade 4 wheat for 1 ore [3]. This would give me 1 ore, but I would still need 2 more ore and 2 wheat for a city upgrade.

The robber is currently on my opponent's ore hex (1,0,-1), blocking ore production for RED's settlement. This is actually good for me.

With my current resources and limited trading options, I don't see an immediate way to make progress toward victory. I should conserve my resources and wait for better opportunities rather than make suboptimal trades.

<plan>
1. End turn now to avoid making suboptimal trades
2. Focus on accumulating ore and wheat for city upgrades (need 3 ore, 2 wheat)
3. Buy development cards when possible (need 1 ore, 1 wheat, 1 sheep)
4. Path to victory: upgrade settlement to cities (7 VP total) + build new settlement (8 VP) + aim for more VP cards or another settlement for the win
</plan>

Since none of the maritime trades advance my position effectively, and I shouldn't deplete my wheat reserve on a poor exchange rate, the optimal move is to end my turn and wait for better dice rolls.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and available options:

**Current Status:**
- I have 5 victory points (1 settlement, 1 city, Largest Army bonus)
- RED has 7 victory points (3 settlements, 1 city, Longest Road bonus)
- My resources: 4 Wood, 4 Wheat
- I need more Ore to build cities or development cards

**My Priority Needs:**
- Ore is my critical resource - none currently in hand
- Need Brick for roads/settlements
- Sheep needed for development cards

**Available Actions:**
- End turn [0]
- Various maritime trades [1-8] at unfavorable 4:1 ratios

## Strategic Analysis

RED is at 7 points and ahead of me. I need to make progress toward my path to victory. Looking at my current resources:
- I can't build a settlement (need brick and sheep)
- I can't build a city (need 3 ore, 2 wheat)
- I can't buy a development card (need ore and sheep)

My trading options are all at 4:1 ratio, which is very inefficient. If I trade now, I'd be left with too few resources and wouldn't be able to complete a meaningful build.

The robber is on ore (1,0,-1), blocking a key resource I need. This makes ore even more scarce.

Given my current situation, I should:
1. Hold my resources
2. End my turn
3. Wait for better dice rolls to get the ore and other resources I need

<plan>
1. End turn to preserve resources
2. Focus on accumulating ore (primary need) and brick for next moves
3. When possible, buy development cards for potential victory points
4. Look to upgrade settlement to city (priority when ore is available)
5. If I roll a 7 or play a knight, move robber off ore hex
</plan>

Since I don't have the right combination of resources to make any efficient trades or builds, the optimal move is to end my turn and maintain my resource position for future opportunities.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 72 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. End turn to preserve resources
2. Focus on accumulating ore (primary need) and brick for next moves
3. When possible, buy development cards for potential victory points
4. Look to upgrade settlement to city (priority when ore is available)
5. If I roll a 7 or play a knight, move robber off ore hex
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and available options:

## Victory Points
- BLUE (me): 5/10 VP (1 settlement, 1 city, largest army)
- RED: 7/10 VP (3 settlements, 1 city, longest road)

## Resources
- I have: 4 wood, 4 wheat
- RED has 7 hidden cards
- The robber is on my ore hex (1,0,-1), blocking one of my primary ore sources

## Development Card Strategy
I've played 3 knights already (giving me largest army) and 1 monopoly card. I currently have no development cards in hand.

## Available Options
I only have trade options or ending my turn. I have no resources to build anything or buy development cards.

## Strategic Considerations

1. RED is at 7 VP, so they're close to winning.
2. I'm at 5 VP and need ore to upgrade my settlement to a city.
3. I could trade 4 wood or 4 wheat for other resources, but I'd be using all of one resource type.
4. The robber is on my ore hex, blocking a key resource I need.
5. I might want to save resources for building opportunities after my next roll.

## Decision Analysis

Trading 4 wood or 4 wheat for 1 ore would allow me to collect 1 ore, but I'd still need 2 more ore and 2 wheat for a city upgrade. This doesn't get me to an immediate build.

Given I have no immediate build options and trading would deplete my resources without a clear path to a build, the best option is to end my turn (option 0) and hope for a better roll next turn.

<plan>
1. End turn now to preserve resources
2. Focus on accumulating ore (primary need) and brick for future builds
3. If I roll a 7 or play a knight, move robber off my ore hex
4. When I have sufficient ore, prioritize city upgrade
5. Consider development card purchase if I get ore/wheat/sheep

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and available actions:

## Victory Points
- I (BLUE) have 5 VP: 1 settlement (1 VP) + 1 city (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
- RED has 8 VP: 4 settlements (4 VP) + 1 city (2 VP) + longest road (2 VP)
- RED is just 2 VP away from winning

## Resources
- I have: 3 wood, 3 wheat, 3 ore
- RED has 7 hidden cards
- The robber is on my wheat hex (-1, -1, 2), reducing my wheat production

## Available Actions
- [0] End turn
- [1] Upgrade settlement at node 10 to city (Cost: 2 wheat, 3 ore)

## Strategic Considerations

1. **Opponent's Position**: RED is at 8 VP and could potentially win on their next turn, especially if they have development cards.

2. **City Upgrade Analysis**: 
   - Cost: 2 wheat, 3 ore (I have exactly enough)
   - Benefits: +1 VP (increases me to 6 VP)
   - Production increase: Node 10 produces resources on 5, 8, and 10 (good numbers)
   - This would double my production from that node

3. **Resource Conservation**:
   - Ending turn keeps my resources, but RED is close to winning
   - If I don't use my resources now, I risk losing them to a "7" roll or knight card

4. **Time Pressure**: 
   - RED is at 8 VP and could win soon
   - I need to accelerate my path to victory

<plan>
1. Build city at node 10 to gain 1 VP (reaching 6 VP total)
2. Focus on getting development cards on future turns for potential victory points
3. Look to build another settlement in a strategic location
4. Continue to build toward 10 VP through cities and development cards
</plan>

The optimal move is clear: I should upgrade my settlement to a city. This gives me an immediate VP, bringing me to 6 VP, and doubles my production at an important node with good probability numbers. Since RED is at 8 VP and could potentially win on their next turn, I need to make progress toward victory now.

   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

# Initial Settlement Placement Analysis

I need to choose my first settlement location strategically since this will be a major factor in my success. This is an initial placement turn, so I don't need to worry about resources yet - I just need to pick the best node.

## Analyzing High-Value Locations

Let me look for nodes with high probability numbers (6 & 8) especially on ore and wheat:
- 🌾6 at (-1, 0, 1) connects to nodes 3, 4, 12, 13, 14, 15
- ⛏️8 at (0, 1, -1) connects to nodes 0, 5, 16, 19, 20, 21

The ore hex with an 8 is particularly valuable. Node 19 is already taken by RED player.

Let me check nodes that give access to multiple good resources, focusing on ore/wheat combinations:

Node 10: Connected to 🌾8, 🧱10, and 🐑3 - excellent wheat on an 8!
Node 11: Connected to 🌾8, 🌾5, and 🐑3 - double wheat but only moderate numbers
Node 8: Connected to 🧱10, ⛏️10, and 🌲2 - good ore/brick but poor wood
Node 16: Connected to ⛏️8, 🌲9, and ⛏️3 - excellent ore on an 8!

## Port Considerations
The ore port (nodes 40, 44) and wheat port (nodes 35, 36) would complement my development card strategy.

## Strategic Position
I need to consider future expansion opportunities and preventing isolation.

## Final Decision
Node 10 gives me access to wheat (8), brick (10), and sheep (3) - excellent wheat production, decent brick, and some sheep.
Node 16 gives me access to ore (8), wood (9), and ore (3) - excellent ore production and wood.

Since my primary strategy is focused on development cards and cities, I need both ore and wheat. Node 16 is particularly strong for ore on an 8 and wood on a 9, which will let me build roads and buy development cards. 

<plan>
1. Place first settlement at node 16 to secure ore (8) and wood (9)
2. For second settlement, look for wheat, sheep, and possibly another ore/wheat hex
3. Build toward ore port or wheat port for efficient trading
4. Focus on development cards (ore/wheat/sheep) and city upgrades (ore/wheat)
</plan>

I'm choosing node 16 (action 16) which gives me excellent ore production on an 8, good wood production on a 9, and additional ore on a 3.

# Game Analysis: Initial Road Placement Decision

I need to decide on my initial road placement after establishing my first settlement at node 16. This is a critical decision that will influence my expansion path and future resource access.

## Settlement Analysis
My first settlement at node 16 connects to:
- Ore (8) - excellent high-probability hex ⭐⭐⭐
- Wood (9) - good probability hex ⭐⭐
- Ore (3) - low probability hex ⭐

This gives me strong ore production and decent wood, but I'm missing wheat, sheep, and brick completely.

## Road Options
I have three options:
- [0] Build road at edge (5, 16): Moves toward the desert and sheep (9) hex
- [1] Build road at edge (16, 21): Moves toward ore (8) and brick (4)
- [2] Build road at edge (16, 18): Moves toward ore (3) and brick (5)

## Strategic Analysis

First, I should check where I want to place my second settlement. I need to prioritize:
1. Access to wheat (missing completely)
2. Access to sheep (missing completely)
3. Access to brick (missing completely)
4. Additional ore/wheat for development card strategy

Looking at the board:
- The wheat (8) hex at (0, -2, 2) is highly valuable
- There's another wheat (6) hex at (-1, 0, 1)
- There's a sheep (9) hex at (1, 0, -1)

Option [1] toward node 21 leads to:
- Node 43: connects to brick (4) and ore (3)
- Can potentially reach node 45 which connects to the wood port
- This path doesn't give me access to wheat or sheep

Option [2] toward node 18 leads:
- Eventually toward wheat hexes in the upper left
- Can connect to node 40 which has the ore port
- Path toward wheat (6) and sheep (4) hexes

Option [0] toward node 5 leads:
- Toward sheep (9) hex
- Eventually could reach wheat (12) but that's low probability
- Not ideal for accessing high-value wheat

<plan>
1. Build my first road toward node 18 to target wheat hexes in the upper left
2. Place second settlement at a node connected to wheat and sheep
3. Continue development card strategy with ore/wheat/sheep
4. Use the ore port for efficient trading since I have strong ore production
</plan>

Looking at these options, the road placement at edge (16, 18) gives me the best path to secure my missing critical resources, particularly wheat. It also provides access to the ore port which complements my strong ore production.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 1 | Player: BLUE | Action: BUILD_INITIAL_SETTLEMENT

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build my first road toward node 18 to target wheat hexes in the upper left
2. Place second settlement at a node connected to wheat and sheep
3. Continue development card strategy with ore/wheat/sheep
4. Use the ore port for efficient trading since I have strong ore production
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.
  To adjust your plan, provide a NEW PLAN in your reasoning with <plan>your new plan</plan>

# Analyzing Initial Settlement Placement Options

I need to place my second settlement strategically to complement my first settlement and maximize my chances of winning. Let me analyze the board and potential settlement locations.

## Current Resources
My first settlement (at node 16) produces:
- 🌲 Wood on a 9 (medium-high probability)
- ⛏️ Ore on an 8 (high probability)
- ⛏️ Ore on a 3 (low probability)

I already have good ore production but need to diversify, especially to get wheat and sheep for my development card strategy.

## Priority Needs
1. Wheat (essential for settlements, cities, and dev cards)
2. Sheep (needed for development cards)
3. Brick (needed for settlements and roads)

## Best Node Analysis
Looking at high-value nodes:

- Node 12: Connects to 🌾Wheat(6), 🐑Sheep(3), 🌾Wheat(5) - Great for wheat production and adds sheep
- Node 13: Connects to 🌾Wheat(6), 🌾Wheat(5), 🌲Wood(11) - Excellent wheat production
- Node 14: Connects to 🌾Wheat(6), 🌲Wood(11), 🐑Sheep(4) - Good mix of resources
- Node 32: Connects to 🌾Wheat(8), 🌾Wheat(5), plus a 3:1 port - High wheat production with port access
- Node 10: Connects to 🌾Wheat(8), 🐑Sheep(3), 🧱Brick(10) - Good mix with high-probability wheat

## Decision Reasoning
Node 13 stands out as an excellent choice because:
1. It provides two wheat sources (one with high-value 6)
2. It adds wood on a decent 11 probability
3. It gives me good positioning for development card strategy with ore from my first settlement and wheat from this one
4. It's close to the wheat port (nodes 35-36) for future expansion
5. It doesn't conflict with my current settlement

Node 12 is also strong, but Node 13 gives slightly better wheat production potential with the added wood.

<plan>
1. Place my second settlement at node 13 to secure strong wheat production
2. Focus on development card strategy with my ore and wheat resources
3. Use knights strategically to protect my high-value tiles
4. Expand toward the wheat port when possible
5. Work toward cities to maximize my ore production from my first settlement
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I'll place my second settlement at node 13.

- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:

- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Analysis of Road Building Options

I need to plan my initial road placement carefully since this will determine my future expansion opportunities.

Let me analyze each of the three road options:

**Option [0] - Road at edge (13, 14)**
- Direction: This leads toward the west/northwest
- Resources in that direction: Connects toward the 🌲11 hex and the 🐑4 hex
- Strategic value: Could eventually access the ore port (nodes 40, 44) if I expand northwestward
- Would allow me to potentially block RED's expansion northward

**Option [1] - Road at edge (12, 13)**
- Direction: This leads toward the northeast
- Resources in that direction: Connects toward the 🐑3 hex
- Strategic value: Limited immediate resource diversity in this direction
- Does not create strong expansion opportunities

**Option [2] - Road at edge (13, 34)**
- Direction: This leads toward the south/southwest
- Resources in that direction: Connects toward the 🌾5 hex and potentially the wheat port
- Strategic value: Provides direct path to the wheat port (nodes 35, 36)
- Excellent for my current strategy focusing on wheat production and cities

## Strategic Considerations
1. My current plan involves maximizing wheat production and aiming for development cards
2. I've already secured strong wheat production with my settlements at nodes 13 and 16
3. Access to the wheat port would be extremely valuable given my production strength
4. I need to ensure a path for expansion to maintain resource diversity

## Decision Logic
Looking at my initial settlement placements, I already have good ore and wheat production. The wheat port would significantly enhance my strategy by allowing me to trade excess wheat for other resources at a favorable 2:1 ratio.

Option [2] builds directly toward the wheat port, which aligns perfectly with my development card and city-focused strategy. This road creates a clear path to the port and allows me to potentially secure additional wheat production along the way.

<plan>
1. Build road toward wheat port (edge 13-34)
2. Save resources for development cards
3. Work toward securing wheat port with next settlement
4. Use excess wheat production efficiently via port trading
5. Focus on city upgrades and knights to maximize ore and wheat production
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

# Turn Analysis for Blue Player

Let me carefully analyze the current game state and available options to determine the optimal move.

## Current Resources
- 1 🌲 WOOD
- 4 🌾 WHEAT
- 3 ⛏️ ORE

## Victory Point Status
- Blue: 2/10 VP (2 settlements)
- Red: 3/10 VP (1 settlement, 1 city)

## Production Assessment
I have two settlements:
- Node 16: 🌲9[⭐⭐], ⛏️8[⭐⭐⭐], ⛏️3[⭐] (good ore production)
- Node 13: 🌾6[⭐⭐⭐], 🌾5[⭐⭐], 🌲11[⭐] (excellent wheat production)

## Available Actions Analysis

### Option 0: End Turn
- Not optimal since I have resources to make a meaningful move.

### Options 1 & 2: Upgrade Settlement to City
- I have exactly enough resources for one city upgrade (2 wheat + 3 ore)
- City at node 16 would boost ore production (8 & 3 rolls)
- City at node 13 would boost wheat production (6 & 5 rolls)

### Options 3-6: Maritime Trade
- Trading 4 wheat for 1 of another resource isn't efficient when I should be using my wheat for building.

## Strategic Decision Making

Looking at my current plan and situation:
1. City upgrades provide the best VP-to-resource ratio (2 resources per VP compared to 2.5 for settlements)
2. I need to decide which production boost is more valuable

Node 16 (ore focus):
- Boosts ⛏️8 (excellent probability) and ⛏️3 (poor probability)
- Ore is critical for cities and development cards

Node 13 (wheat focus):
- Boosts 🌾6 (excellent probability) and 🌾5 (good probability)
- Wheat is needed for cities, settlements, and development cards
- Already producing well with current settlement

The ore-focused city (node 16) makes more strategic sense because:
1. Doubling ore production helps unlock more development cards and future city upgrades
2. My wheat production is already strong at node 13
3. Ore has been identified as a critical resource in my development card strategy

<plan>
1. Upgrade settlement at node 16 to city to boost ore production
2. Continue saving for development cards
3. Build road toward wheat port when resources allow
4. Aim for largest army bonus through knights
5. Target 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan - Turn 9

Let me analyze the current game state and my available options:

## Current Status
- I have 3/10 victory points (1 settlement + 1 city)
- Resources: 1 Wood, 4 Wheat
- No development cards
- Red (opponent) also has 3 points

## Resource Production Assessment
- I have strong production of wheat (from nodes 13 and 6)
- I have good ore production at node 16 (city on 8 ore)
- I'm lacking brick and sheep production

## Available Actions Analysis
My options are limited this turn:
- [0] End turn
- [1-4] Maritime trades giving 4 wheat for another resource

Since I have 4 wheat, I could trade for a resource, but the standard 4:1 port rate is very inefficient. Let's examine what resources I need most based on my strategic goals:

## Strategic Considerations

1. **Development Card Strategy**:
   - Requires 1 ore + 1 wheat + 1 sheep
   - I have wheat but need ore and sheep
   - This aligns with my current plan

2. **City Upgrade** (Not possible this turn):
   - Requires 3 ore + 2 wheat
   - I have enough wheat but no ore

3. **Road Building**:
   - Requires 1 wood + 1 brick
   - I have 1 wood already but need brick
   - Could help expand toward the wheat port (nodes 35, 36)

## Decision Logic

Trading 4 wheat for 1 ore would help toward development cards, but it's inefficient at 4:1 ratio. I need to save resources to progress my strategy effectively.

The most efficient move is to end my turn and continue accumulating resources. Trading 4 wheat for 1 resource through standard maritime trading is too costly when I can likely get better trades on future turns or accumulate the needed resources naturally.

<plan>
1. Save resources for development cards (need ore and sheep)
2. Continue aiming to build road toward wheat port when resources allow
3. Upgrade settlement to city when possible
4. Pursue largest army through knights
5. Maintain development card strategy for hidden victory points
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze my current position and available options:

**Current Resources**: 4 WHEAT
**Current Victory Points**: 3/10 (1 settlement + 1 city)
**Development Cards**: None
**Current Production**:
- City at node 16: WOOD (9), ORE (8), ORE (3)
- Settlement at node 13: WHEAT (6), WHEAT (5), WOOD (11)

My production focuses on WHEAT, WOOD, and ORE. I have some ORE production but it's currently limited because the robber is on one of my ORE hexes.

## Available Actions
- End turn
- Trade 4 WHEAT for various resources using the standard 4:1 trade ratio

## Strategic Considerations

1. **Resource Analysis**: I have 4 WHEAT and nothing else. My current plan focuses on development cards (need ORE and SHEEP) and eventually building roads toward the wheat port.

2. **Development Card Strategy**: I need 1 ORE, 1 WHEAT, and 1 SHEEP to buy a development card. I have WHEAT, but I'm missing the other resources.

3. **Available Trades**: I could trade 4 WHEAT for 1 ORE, which would give me one of the resources needed for a development card. But I'd still lack SHEEP.

4. **Road Building**: My plan mentions building roads toward the wheat port (nodes 35, 36). From my settlement at node 13, I'd need to build through nodes 34 → 35/36 to reach the port. I already have a road to node 34.

5. **City Upgrade**: The plan mentions upgrading a settlement to a city, but I only have one settlement left, and I don't have the resources for a city upgrade (3 ORE + 2 WHEAT).

## Decision Process

Since I only have WHEAT and no other resources, my options are limited:

1. **Trade for ORE?** Trading WHEAT for ORE would give me one component for a development card, but I'd still need SHEEP. I'd also be left with no resources.

2. **End Turn?** By ending my turn, I preserve my 4 WHEAT. On my next turn, I might roll and gain additional resources that complement my WHEAT, potentially allowing for a more efficient use of resources.

The most efficient path appears to be saving my resources for now. Trading 4:1 is very inefficient, and I don't have a clear immediate build that would significantly advance my position. If I wait, I might gain complementary resources on the next turn.

<plan>
1. End turn to conserve resources
2. Continue saving for development cards when I acquire ORE and SHEEP
3. Build road toward wheat port when I have the resources (WOOD and BRICK)
4. Upgrade settlement to city when resources allow
5. Pursue largest army through knights

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze my current position and available options:

## Current Resources
- 2 🌲WOOD
- 4 🌾WHEAT
- No SHEEP, ORE, or BRICK

## Victory Points (3/10)
- 1 Settlement (1 VP)
- 1 City (2 VP)

## Building Options
I don't have resources to build anything right now. I need:
- Settlement (1 WOOD, 1 BRICK, 1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT)
- City (3 ORE, 2 WHEAT)
- Road (1 WOOD, 1 BRICK)
- Development Card (1 ORE, 1 WHEAT, 1 SHEEP)

## Trade Options
I can trade 4 WHEAT for 1 of any resource. This is extremely inefficient and would deplete my WHEAT stockpile.

## Resource Production
- My buildings produce WHEAT, WOOD, and ORE
- The robber is on an ORE hex that I produce from
- I lack SHEEP and BRICK production

## Strategic Analysis
1. Wheat is my strongest resource (good 6 and 5 production)
2. With 4 WHEAT, I could trade for missing resources but at a poor 4:1 ratio
3. Waiting is reasonable since I need high-value rolls to get more resources
4. Building a road toward the wheat port (nodes 35, 36) could be beneficial in future turns
5. RED player has 4 VP and 5 cards, which makes them the current leader

## Trading Considerations
- Trading 4 WHEAT for 1 resource would deplete my strongest resource
- I'd still be short multiple resources for any meaningful build
- I'm not in immediate danger of losing to RED (they have 4 VP)

<plan>
1. End turn to conserve resources
2. Focus on acquiring ORE for city upgrades and development cards
3. Build toward wheat port when I have WOOD+BRICK
4. Watch for opportunities to play knights for largest army
5. Calculate most efficient path to victory: likely 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) = 10 VP
</plan>

Given my current resources, the board state, and long-term strategy, it's best to conserve my resources and end my turn. None of the trades are efficient, and I should wait for better production rolls.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Analysis of Current Game State

Let me analyze the game state carefully to determine the best move:

## Current Status
- I have 3 victory points (1 settlement + 1 city)
- Resources: 2 wood, 6 wheat (excess wheat)
- No development cards
- Red player has 4 victory points (2 settlements + 1 city)
- Robber is on ore (-1, 2, -1), which is one of my producing hexes

## Resource Production
- I produce wheat very well (6 + 5 numbers)
- I produce wood decently (9 + 11 numbers)
- I produce ore from two hexes (8 + 3), but one is blocked by the robber

## Available Actions
- I can end my turn and save resources
- I can trade 4 wheat for another resource (wood, sheep, ore, or brick)

## Strategic Considerations:

1. **Victory Path Analysis**: 
   - I need 7 more VP to win
   - Current plan is to build cities (2 VP each) and settlements (1 VP each)
   - I could also pursue development cards for hidden VP or largest army

2. **Resource Needs**:
   - Building a road requires wood + brick (I have wood but no brick)
   - Building a settlement requires wood + brick + wheat + sheep (I have wood and wheat)
   - Building a city requires 3 ore + 2 wheat (I have wheat but no ore)
   - Development card requires ore + wheat + sheep (I have wheat but no ore/sheep)

3. **Maritime Trading Analysis**:
   - I have excess wheat (6) that I could trade
   - Trading 4:1 is inefficient but might be necessary to unblock my position
   - Priority resources I need: ore (for cities/dev cards), brick (for roads/settlements)

4. **Decision Matrix**:
   - End turn: Conserve resources, but risk discarding if a 7 is rolled (I have 8 cards)
   - Trade wheat for ore: Enable potential development card purchase
   - Trade wheat for brick: Enable road building which could lead to expansion

## Decision Logic:
Given that I have 8 resources, there's a risk of losing half if a 7 is rolled. Additionally, my strategic focus is on city building (requires ore) and development cards (requires ore and sheep).

Trading 4 wheat for 1 ore would allow me to be in position for a development card purchase when I get a sheep. Since I already have 2 wood, this is more efficient than trading for brick right now.

<plan>
1. Trade excess wheat for ore to help set up for development cards or cities
2. Continue focusing on accumulating ore and wheat for city upgrades
3. When possible, expand toward more ore production or the wheat port
4. Watch for opportunities to build development cards as sheep becomes available
5. Calculate most efficient path to victory: 4 cities (8 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) = 10 VP
</plan>

# Game Analysis for Catan Turn 17

Let me analyze the current state of the game to determine the optimal action:

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 3 VP (1 settlement + 1 city + 0 special cards)
- I have resources: 2 wood, 3 wheat, 3 ore
- Red has 4 VP (2 settlements + 1 city) and 9 cards in hand (concerning amount)
- The robber is on the ore hex (-1,2,-1), which affects my city at node 16

## Available Actions Analysis
[0] End turn - Keep my current resources
[1] Upgrade settlement to city at node 13 - Cost: 2 wheat, 3 ore

## Victory Point Calculation
- If I build the city, I increase my VPs from 3 to 4
- This puts me at 4 VP versus Red's 4 VP, equalizing our positions
- Settlement at node 13 produces wheat (5 & 6) and wood (11) - upgrading would double this valuable wheat production

## Strategic Considerations
1. **Resource Value**: My settlement at node 13 produces wheat on two numbers (5 & 6), making it an excellent city upgrade target
2. **Path to Victory**: City upgrades are efficient (5 resources for 1 VP)
3. **Resource Production**: After building the city, I'll have 1 wheat left, which positions me to gather more resources for my next build
4. **Opponent Analysis**: Red has 9 cards - they may be close to making a significant move

## Decision Logic
Building the city now is optimal because:
- It immediately increases my VPs, keeping pace with Red
- It doubles my wheat production, which is crucial for both development cards and cities
- Wheat is one of my primary resources with two good numbers (5 & 6)
- I have exactly the resources needed for this upgrade
- Red has many cards and might make a big move soon - I need to keep up

<plan>
1. Upgrade settlement at node 13 to a city to double wheat production
2. Next gather resources for development cards (sheep/ore/wheat)
3. Continue to focus on city upgrades for efficient VP gain
4. Look to extend roads toward potential settlement locations, particularly ones with ore or ports
5. Path to victory: 4 cities (8 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 11 VP
</plan>

Based on this analysis, the optimal play is to upgrade my settlement to a city.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Turn 19

## Current Game State Assessment
- I have 4 VP (2 cities)
- I have 4 🌲WOOD and 1 🌾WHEAT as resources
- My plan involves upgrading settlements to cities and pursuing development cards
- Robber is on (-1, 2, -1) which is an ore hex with dice number 3 (low probability)
- RED player is ahead with 5 VP (2 cities, 1 settlement)

## Resource Analysis
- I have plenty of wood but insufficient resources for any major build
- Critical resources I need:
  - For city upgrade: 3 ore + 2 wheat (I have 1 wheat, missing all ore)
  - For development card: 1 ore + 1 wheat + 1 sheep (I have 1 wheat, missing ore and sheep)
  - For new settlement: 1 brick + 1 sheep + 1 wheat + 1 wood (I have 1 wheat and 4 wood)

## Available Actions Evaluation
- [0] End turn - This wastes my current wood resources with no progress
- [1-4] Trading options - All involve trading 4 wood for 1 resource through the bank

Since I can't build anything directly with my current resources, and I have excess wood, a maritime trade makes sense. The question is which resource to acquire.

## Trade Decision Analysis
Looking at my needs:
- Ore is most critical for my city upgrade strategy and development cards
- Sheep would help for development cards
- Brick could help toward a settlement, but I'm focusing on cities
- Additional wheat would help toward both cities and development cards

Given my current plan of focusing on city upgrades and development cards, and considering that ore is the hardest resource for me to acquire (my production is limited to a 3 on one hex), trading for ore makes the most strategic sense.

<plan>
1. Trade for ore to work toward development cards (1 ore + 1 wheat + 1 sheep)
2. Continue gathering resources for city upgrades (need 3 ore + 2 wheat per city)
3. If I gather additional wheat/ore/sheep, prioritize development cards for knights and victory points
4. Path to victory remains: 4 cities (8 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
5. Consider settlement expansion only after securing more development cards
</plan>

Trading 4 wood for 1 ore is the optimal move this turn, as it advances me toward both potential development cards and city upgrades.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state, my resources, and available actions:

## Current Game State
- I have 4 VP (2 cities)
- Red has 5 VP (2 cities + 1 settlement)
- I have: 2 🌲WOOD, 5 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE
- No development cards in hand
- The robber is on (-1, 2, -1) - an ore hex

## My Current Plan & Victory Path
My current plan focuses on development cards and city upgrades:
- Path to victory: 4 cities (8 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- I already have 2 cities (4 VP)
- I need resources for development cards and additional cities

## Available Actions
I can either end my turn or trade via maritime trading:
1. Trade 4 WHEAT for 1 WOOD
2. Trade 4 WHEAT for 1 SHEEP
3. Trade 4 WHEAT for 1 ORE
4. Trade 4 WHEAT for 1 BRICK

## Strategic Analysis

Looking at my available resources and victory path:
- I need ORE+WHEAT+SHEEP for development cards
- I need ORE+WHEAT for city upgrades
- I have plenty of WHEAT (5) but insufficient ORE (only 1)

My immediate bottleneck is ORE. For development cards, I need additional ORE and SHEEP (missing). For city upgrades, I need more ORE (have only 1, need 3).

Trading 4 WHEAT for 1 ORE would give me 2 ORE total, moving me toward either a development card (if I can get SHEEP) or a city upgrade (if I can collect more ORE).

The other trade options don't advance my immediate goals:
- More WOOD doesn't help my development card or city strategy
- SHEEP would help for development cards but ORE is still the bottleneck
- BRICK isn't needed for my current strategy

## Decision
I should trade for ORE (option 3) to continue accumulating the critical resource for either development cards or city upgrades. This keeps me on my path to victory.

<plan>
1. Trade for ore to continue building toward development cards and city upgrades
2. Continue prioritizing ore acquisition on future turns
3. When I have ore+wheat+sheep, buy development cards for knights and victory points
4. Path to victory: 4 cities (8 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Catan Robber Placement Analysis

Let me analyze the optimal robber placement based on the game state:

## Current Situation
- I have 4 VP (2 cities = 4 points)
- RED has 6 VP (2 cities + 2 settlements = 6 points)
- RED is 4 points ahead and closer to winning
- My plan focuses on development cards, city upgrades and largest army

## Game Resources Analysis
1. RED has settlements/cities producing:
   - Sheep (4, 6, 6, 9)
   - Brick (4, 5) 
   - Wood (9, 11)
   - Wheat (6)
   - Ore (8)

2. I have cities producing:
   - Wheat (5, 6) 
   - Wood (9, 11)
   - Ore (3, 8)

## Robber Placement Priorities
1. Maximize damage to RED (leader)
2. Target high-probability numbers (8, 6)
3. Target resources RED needs but I don't produce well
4. Avoid harming my own production

## Evaluating Options
The best targets are RED's high-probability resource productions:
- Option [5] targets (0, 1, -1): RED's 8-value ore hex (⭐⭐⭐) that RED heavily relies on
- Option [3] targets (-1, 0, 1): RED's 6-value wheat hex (⭐⭐⭐) - critical for development cards

Option [5] is particularly strong because:
1. It blocks RED's valuable ore production (8 = high probability)
2. RED needs ore for cities and development cards
3. I already have ore production, so this creates resource scarcity for RED
4. I can steal a card from RED, potentially getting an ore

<plan>
1. Block RED's ore production to slow their advancement
2. Continue acquiring ore, wheat and sheep for development cards
3. Push toward largest army (2 VP) by playing knight cards
4. Target 3-4 cities total (6-8 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 8-10 VP
5. Monitor RED's progress and continue blocking their key resources
</plan>

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state to determine the optimal action:

## Current Resources
I have:
- 4 🌲 WOOD
- 5 🌾 WHEAT
- 3 ⛏️ ORE
- 0 🐑 SHEEP
- 0 🧱 BRICK

## Victory Point Status
- I have 4 VP (2 cities × 2 VP each)
- RED has 6 VP (2 cities × 2 VP each + 2 settlements × 1 VP each)
- RED is ahead by 2 VP

## Resource Generation
- I have strong wheat production (🌾6[⭐⭐⭐], 🌾5[⭐⭐]) and good ore (⛏️8[⭐⭐⭐], ⛏️3[⭐])
- The robber is currently on the ⛏️8 hex, blocking one of my primary ore sources

## Development Card Strategy Assessment
My current plan emphasizes development cards, which requires:
- 1 🐑 SHEEP
- 1 🌾 WHEAT
- 1 ⛏️ ORE

I have the WHEAT and ORE for a development card, but I'm missing SHEEP.

## Available Actions
Looking at the maritime trade options, I could trade for a SHEEP:
- Option 8: Give 4 🌲WOOD for 1 🐑SHEEP

This would leave me with:
- 0 WOOD
- 5 WHEAT
- 3 ORE
- 1 SHEEP

Then I could buy a development card with 1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE, leaving:
- 0 WOOD
- 4 WHEAT
- 2 ORE
- 0 SHEEP

## Decision Making
Following my development card strategy is critical for victory since I'm behind in points. Getting a development card could yield:
- Victory point card (1 VP)
- Knight card (helps move the robber off my ore and progress toward largest army)
- Year of Plenty or Monopoly (helps get resources I need)

Trading 4 wood for 1 sheep allows me to immediately buy a development card, which aligns with my strategic plan.

<plan>
1. Maritime trade for sheep to enable development card purchase
2. Continue acquiring ore, wheat and sheep for development cards
3. Push toward largest army (2 VP) by playing knight cards
4. Target 3-4 cities total (6-8 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 8-10 VP
5. Monitor RED's progress and continue blocking their key resources
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I should trade 4 wood for 1 sheep (option #8).

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current state of the game and my available options carefully:

## Victory Point Status:
- I (BLUE) have 4 VP (from 2 cities)
- RED has 6 VP (2 settlements + 2 cities)
- RED is 2 points ahead and closer to winning

## My Resources:
- 1 SHEEP, 5 WHEAT, 3 ORE
- Need more SHEEP for development cards

## Production Analysis:
- My cities produce wheat (6, 5), ore (8, 3), and wood (9, 11)
- Strong wheat and ore production, but currently blocked on ore (robber is on 8 ore hex)
- Lacking sheep production
- RED has strong sheep production (nodes 19, 15, 22 all produce sheep)

## Available Actions:
1. Buy a development card (need 1 more sheep)
2. Maritime trade wheat for resources
3. End turn

## Decision Logic:

The development card strategy is optimal given my city-focused position and resource production. Development cards can provide:
- Victory points directly
- Knights to move the robber off my ore production and build toward largest army (2 VP)
- Resource advantages through Year of Plenty or Monopoly cards

I need 1 more sheep to buy a development card. I have 5 wheat, so I can trade 4 wheat for 1 sheep through a maritime trade.

This would leave me with:
- 1 wheat
- 2 sheep
- 3 ore

Enabling me to immediately buy a development card (1 sheep + 1 wheat + 1 ore).

Since RED is at 6 VP already (and may have hidden VP cards), accelerating my development card acquisition is critical.

<plan>
1. Trade wheat for sheep through maritime trade
2. Buy development cards consistently to pursue largest army (2 VP)
3. Use knight cards to protect my ore production
4. Aim for 4 cities total (8 VP) + largest army (2 VP) for the win
5. Be vigilant of RED's progress toward 10 VP
</plan>

I should trade 4 wheat for 1 sheep via maritime trade, which is option #3.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and available actions:

## Current Resources
I have: 2x 🐑SHEEP, 1x 🌾WHEAT, 3x ⛏️ORE

## Victory Point Status
- Me (BLUE): 4 VP (2 cities = 4 VP)
- RED: 6 VP (2 settlements + 2 cities = 6 VP)
- RED is ahead by 2 VP

## Available Actions
1. Buy a development card (1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE)
2. End my turn

## Strategic Considerations

I'm following a development card strategy to win. Development cards can provide:
- Victory point cards (hidden until win)
- Knight cards (for largest army = 2 VP)
- Year of Plenty or Monopoly for resource advantage

Let's evaluate the benefits of buying a development card:
- I have exactly the resources needed (1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE)
- Drawing a VP card would effectively close the gap with RED
- Drawing a knight would put me closer to largest army (2 VP)
- Utility cards provide strategic options for future turns
- If I don't buy a card, my resources are vulnerable to 7s and robber
- RED is at 6 VP, so I need to accelerate my path to victory

My production is good (especially ORE and WHEAT) which are critical for more development cards and city upgrades. The robber is currently on an ore hex (0,1,-1), which happens to be one of my city's production hexes. This reduces my ore production temporarily.

<plan>
1. Continue buying development cards to pursue largest army (2 VP)
2. Look for opportunities to build settlements in future turns to gain more VP
3. Aim for 4 cities total (8 VP) + largest army (2 VP) for the win
4. Be vigilant of RED's progress toward 10 VP
</plan>

The most strategic action is clearly to buy a development card. This aligns with my plan, uses up resources that could be stolen, and gives me a chance at victory points or tactical advantages.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

❓ Select action by number (0-1):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I need to analyze this game state carefully to make the best decision.

Current situation:
- I have 4 VP (2 cities)
- RED has 9 VP (3 settlements + 2 cities + longest road)
- I have resources: 1 sheep, 2 wheat, 2 ore
- I have 1 knight development card
- The robber is on ore hex (0,1,-1) with value 8, which is one of my high-producing hexes
- RED is one point away from winning

Analysis of options:
1. **Play Knight Card (Option 0)**: 
   - This would move the robber off my valuable ore hex (8)
   - I could place it on one of RED's most productive hexes
   - I could potentially steal a resource from RED
   - This starts building toward largest army (2 VP)

2. **Roll the Dice (Option 1)**:
   - If I roll a 7, I move the robber anyway
   - If I roll an 8, the robber blocks my production
   - Since RED has 9 points, they're very close to winning, so I need to be aggressive

Strategic considerations:
- The robber is currently on my high-value ore hex (8), which is critical for my development card strategy
- RED is just 1 point away from winning, so I need to disrupt them
- Playing the knight now lets me move the robber from my hex AND potentially steal a card from RED
- I'm pursuing largest army as part of my win strategy, so playing knights helps toward that

<plan>
1. Play knight to move robber from my ore hex and place it on RED's high-producing hex
2. Continue buying development cards to pursue largest army (2 VP)
3. Look for opportunities to build settlements in future turns
4. Aim for 4 cities total (8 VP) + largest army (2 VP) for the win
5. Disrupt RED whenever possible as they're just 1 VP away from winning
</plan>

Given RED is so close to winning and the robber is blocking my important ore production, I should play my knight card now. This will unblock my valuable production, potentially steal a valuable resource from RED, and start my progress toward largest army.

❓ Select action by number (0-17):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze this game state carefully to determine the best robber placement.

First, I need to understand the game state:
- I (BLUE) have 4 VP with 2 cities
- RED has 9 VP with 3 settlements, 2 cities, and longest road (+2 VP)
- RED is just 1 VP away from winning, making them a major threat
- The robber is currently on a hex (0,1,-1) which has my ore production (⛏️8)
- I need to move the robber and can steal from RED if I place it on a hex with their settlement/city

Let me analyze the key options for robber placement:

1. Move to hexes with RED's highest production:
   - Option [15] - Move to (1,1,-2) 🐑6 - Blocks RED's 🐑6 production affecting both a city and settlement
   - Option [3] - Move to (-1,0,1) 🌾6 - Blocks RED's 🌾6 production from a city
   - Option [5] - Move to (1,0,-1) 🐑9 - Blocks RED's 🐑9 production from a settlement

2. Move to hexes with critical RED resources:
   - Option [6] - Move to (2,-2,0) ⛏️10 - Blocks RED's ⛏️10 from a settlement
   - Option [4] - Move to (-1,1,0) 🌲9 - Blocks RED's 🌲9 from a city

Looking at RED's buildings, they produce:
- ⛏️8 [⭐⭐⭐], 🌾6 [⭐⭐⭐], 🐑6 [⭐⭐⭐] - These are their highest production hexes
- 🌲9 [⭐⭐], 🐑9 [⭐⭐], 🧱5 [⭐⭐] - Secondary production

Option [15] (1,1,-2) is particularly strong because:
1. It blocks RED's 🐑6 hex which is high-probability (⭐⭐⭐)
2. This hex affects both RED's city at node 19 and settlement at node 22
3. I can steal a resource from RED
4. Sheep might be important for RED if they're pursuing development cards

Option [3] (-1,0,1) targets RED's wheat production which is critical for cities and development cards.

<plan>
1. Place robber on RED's high-producing 🐑6 hex to block both their city and settlement
2. Continue buying development cards to pursue largest army (2 VP)
3. Focus on building another settlement when resources allow
4. Aim for 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) for the win
5. Keep disrupting RED's resource production to prevent them from reaching 10 VP
</plan>

Considering all factors, I'll choose option [15] to place the robber on RED's sheep hex (1,1,-2) which has a high production value (6) and affects both a city and settlement.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 29 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

❓ Select action by number (0-1):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze this game state step by step to determine the optimal action.

## Current Victory Point Analysis
- I (BLUE) have 4 VP: 2 cities (4 VP)
- RED has 9 VP: 3 settlements (3 VP) + 2 cities (4 VP) + longest road (2 VP)
- RED is just 1 VP away from winning

## Resource Analysis
I have:
- 1 🐑 SHEEP
- 3 🌾 WHEAT
- 2 ⛏️ ORE

## Available Actions
- [0] End turn
- [1] Buy a development card (1 🐑, 1 🌾, 1 ⛏️)

## Strategic Considerations

1. **Opponent's Status**: RED is just 1 VP away from winning. They likely need one more build (city upgrade or settlement) to win.

2. **Development Card Analysis**: With my resources, I can afford a development card. This could be:
   - Victory point card (25% chance) - would put me at 5 VP
   - Knight card (50% chance) - would help me get Largest Army (2 VP) eventually
   - Monopoly or Year of Plenty (25% chance) - tactical advantages

3. **Current Plan Review**: My plan mentions continuing to buy development cards to pursue largest army. I've already played 1 knight, so I need 2 more for largest army.

4. **Urgency**: If I don't act, RED will likely win soon. The robber is already placed on RED's 🐑6 hex, blocking one of their productive tiles.

## Decision Logic
- Buying a development card is my ONLY meaningful action available
- It gives me a chance at a victory point card (immediate +1 VP)
- It gives me a 50% chance at a knight (progress toward largest army)
- Even utility cards (monopoly/year of plenty) could help me build faster or disrupt RED
- Since RED is at 9 VP, I must take this chance to potentially slow them down or accelerate my progress

<plan>
1. Buy development cards to get either victory points or knights
2. Focus on reaching largest army (need 2 more knights)
3. Work toward additional settlements when I gather enough resources
4. Try to reach 10 VP through: 2 cities (4 VP) + 3-4 VP from development cards + largest army (2 VP)
5. Continue to disrupt RED's resource production whenever possible
</plan>

I need to be aggressive in my development card strategy as it's my best path to victory, especially with RED so close to winning.

# Game Analysis for Turn 31

I need to carefully evaluate my options as BLUE player with 4/10 victory points, while RED has 9/10 victory points and is on the verge of winning.

## Current Situation Assessment
- I have 4 VP (2 cities = 4 VP) + 1 hidden VP card = 5 VP total
- RED has 9 VP (3 settlements + 2 cities + longest road) and needs just 1 more VP to win
- I have 6 WHEAT and 1 ORE
- RED has 5 hidden resource cards
- The robber is on (1, 1, -2), which is a SHEEP hex with value 6 (good production)
- I have played 1 knight card, and need 2 more for largest army (+2 VP)

## Options Analysis

**Option 0: End Turn**
- If I end my turn with 6 wheat and 1 ore, I risk:
  1. Having to discard if a 7 is rolled
  2. Not making progress toward catching up to RED
  3. Giving RED another turn where they might win

**Options 1-4: Maritime Trade**
- All trade options require 4 WHEAT for 1 resource (standard 4:1 port ratio)
- Trading would leave me with 2 WHEAT and either 1 ORE plus one more resource
- I have no immediate build options after trading

## Strategic Considerations

1. **Development Card Strategy**:
   - A development card costs 1 ORE + 1 WHEAT + 1 SHEEP
   - I have 1 ORE and 6 WHEAT, but no SHEEP
   - Trading for a SHEEP would allow me to buy a development card

2. **Victory Path:**
   - I need 5 more VP to win (currently at 5 VP counting my hidden VP card)
   - Potential sources: 2 settlements (2 VP), largest army (2 VP), VP cards (need 1+ more)
   - Development cards give me chances for knights (toward largest army) or direct VP cards

3. **Resource Management:**
   - 6 WHEAT is excessive and risks loss if a 7 is rolled
   - Converting some WHEAT through trading is sensible

## Decision Logic

Given RED is at 9 VP, I need to make the most impactful move. Trading 4 WHEAT for 1 SHEEP would enable me to buy a development card, which could be:
- A knight (helping toward largest army)
- A victory point card (bringing me closer to 10 VP)
- Another useful action card

This is clearly my best move since development cards are my primary path to victory according to my current plan.

<plan>
1. Trade for SHEEP to buy development cards
2. Focus on reaching largest army (need 2 more knights)
3. Collect VP development cards whenever possible
4. Work toward a path to 10 VP through: 2 cities (4 VP) + VP cards + largest army (2 VP)
5. Disrupt RED's resource production when possible
</plan>

Therefore, I will choose option 2: Trade port: Give 4 WHEAT for 1 SHEEP.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

❓ Select action by number (0-1):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll carefully analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action.

## Current Game Analysis

First, let's assess the game state:

1. **Victory Points:**
   - Red: 9/10 VP (3 settlements, 2 cities, longest road)
   - Blue (me): 4/10 VP (0 settlements, 2 cities, 1 hidden VP card) + 1 knight played

2. **Resources:**
   - I have: 1 SHEEP, 2 WHEAT, 1 ORE
   - This is exactly what I need to buy a development card

3. **Critical Situation:**
   - Red is at 9 VP and likely just needs one more development to win
   - I need to maximize my chance of winning and/or prevent Red from winning

4. **Development Card Analysis:**
   - With 23 development cards remaining, probability breakdown is favorable:
     - 5 victory point cards (21.7% chance)
     - 14 knights (60.9% chance)
     - 2 monopoly cards (8.7% chance)
     - 2 year of plenty cards (8.7% chance)
   - I already have 1 knight played, so 2 more would give me largest army (2 VP)

## Strategic Decision
This is a critical moment. Red is at 9 VP and likely to win next turn. I currently have 4 VP (2 cities + 1 hidden VP card) plus 1 knight played. My path to victory requires development cards since I'm far behind in the visible board position.

If I buy a development card:
- 21.7% chance of getting a VP card (immediate progress)
- 60.9% chance of getting a knight (progress toward largest army)
- 17.4% chance of getting a utility card that could help me gather resources

Given that Red is one point away from winning, buying a development card is my best option. It allows me to potentially get a VP card or progress toward largest army while keeping my options open.

<plan>
1. Buy development cards to accumulate victory points and knights
2. Reach largest army (need 2 more knights)
3. Continue collecting VP development cards
4. Target 10 VP through: 2 cities (4 VP) + VP cards (possibly 3-4 VP) + largest army (2 VP)
5. If I get utility cards, use them to disrupt Red and gather resources for more development cards
</plan>

The optimal action is to buy a development card:

# Game Analysis

Let me assess the current game state and my options:

## Victory Points Assessment
- I currently have 4 visible VP (2 cities = 4 VP)
- I have 1 hidden VP card
- If I play my knight card and get 2 more knights, I can get Largest Army (2 VP)
- That would give me 7 VP, still needing 3 more to win

## RED Player Analysis
- RED has 9 VP (3 settlements = 3 VP, 2 cities = 4 VP, longest road = 2 VP)
- They are just 1 VP away from winning
- This makes RED an immediate threat who could win on their next turn

## Options Analysis
1. **Play Knight Card** (Option 0)
   - This would let me move the robber from the RED player's productive hex (🐑6)
   - I could steal a resource from RED (they have 2 cards)
   - This advances me toward Largest Army (would have 2 knights played)
   - Disrupts RED who is on the verge of winning

2. **Roll Dice** (Option 1)
   - Standard dice roll may give me resources
   - If I roll a 7, I could still place the robber and steal
   - However, RED will get their turn next and they're close to winning

## Strategic Consideration
The most urgent priority is preventing RED from winning. They have 9 VP and could potentially get their 10th VP on their next turn. Playing the knight card now allows me to:

1. Move the robber from their productive 🐑6 hex (currently blocked by robber)
2. Potentially steal a useful resource
3. Make progress toward largest army
4. Potentially disrupt their building plans

<plan>
1. Play knight card now to disrupt RED and move toward largest army
2. Move robber to RED's most productive hex (either 🌾6 or ⛏️8)
3. Continue buying development cards to get more knights and VP cards
4. Target 10 VP through: 2 cities (4 VP) + VP cards (3+ VP) + largest army (2 VP)
</plan>

Given RED is just 1 point away from winning, disrupting them is the highest priority. Playing the knight card now is the optimal defensive and strategic move.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Robber Placement

I need to analyze where to place the robber to maximize my advantage while disrupting RED, who is dangerously close to winning with 9/10 victory points.

## Current Game State Assessment
- RED is at 9/10 VP (with Longest Road bonus)
- I'm at 4/10 VP plus 1 hidden victory point card (5/10 total)
- RED has major settlements/cities on high-producing hexes
- I've already played 2 knights, so I'm on track for Largest Army (2 VP)

## Robber Placement Options Analysis

I should target RED's most productive resources. Let me check RED's buildings and their production:
- RED has a city at node 19: produces ⛏️8[⭐⭐⭐], 🧱4[⭐], 🐑6[⭐⭐⭐]
- RED has a city at node 15: produces 🌾6[⭐⭐⭐], 🌲9[⭐⭐], 🐑4[⭐]
- RED has productive settlements at nodes 22, 39, and 7

The most impactful hexes for RED are:
1. Ore 8 - highly productive (⭐⭐⭐) and critical for city upgrades
2. Wheat 6 - highly productive (⭐⭐⭐) and critical for development cards/cities
3. Sheep 6 - highly productive (⭐⭐⭐) and helpful for development cards

Looking at hex (0, 1, -1) which is ⛏️8 - this is a crucial resource for both RED and me. However, I need to block RED's progress more than I need to maintain my production, as they're close to winning.

Option 5 would place the robber on hex (0, 1, -1) with ⛏️8 dice roll, blocking RED's city at node 19 while also stealing a card from RED. This denies them a critical resource for city building.

Alternatively, option 3 would place the robber on hex (-1, 0, 1) with 🌾6 dice roll, blocking RED's city at node 15 from wheat production, which is also critical for development cards and cities.

Between these two options, blocking the ore hex (option 5) seems more strategically sound because:
1. Ore is more difficult to obtain than wheat generally
2. Blocking ore significantly hampers RED's ability to build additional cities
3. I have another wheat source so blocking wheat hurts me too

<plan>
1. Block RED's ore production by placing robber on ⛏️8 hex
2. Continue buying development cards for knights and VP cards
3. Work toward Largest Army (2 VP) by playing knights
4. Target 10 VP through: 2 cities (4 VP) + VP cards (3+ VP) + largest army (2 VP)
</plan>

Therefore, I'll choose option 5 to move the robber to the ore hex (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED.

# Game Analysis for Catan Turn 35

Let me analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action as Blue player.

## Current Game State
- I have 4 VP currently (2 cities, 1 hidden VP card)
- Red has 9 VP (5 regular VP + 2 longest road + 2 settlement VP)
- My resources: 4 Wood, 5 Wheat, 1 Ore
- I've played 2 knights already
- The robber is on the 8-ore hex, blocking my ore production

## Strategic Assessment
Red is at 9 VP and very close to winning. My current plan involves:
1. Blocking Red's ore production
2. Buying development cards for knights and VP
3. Working toward Largest Army
4. Targeting 10 VP through cities, VP cards, and largest army

The robber is already on the ore-8 hex, which blocks both my city at node 16 and Red's city at node 19. This is good positioning for now.

## Available Actions
My options are to end turn or make a maritime trade. I don't have enough resources to build a settlement (need brick and sheep), upgrade to city (need 3 ore, 2 wheat), or buy a development card (need ore, wheat, sheep).

Looking at the trades:
- I could trade 4 wood for 1 brick (#5)
- I could trade 4 wheat for 1 sheep (#2)

These would help me work toward building a settlement. However, trading 4:1 is very inefficient.

## Decision Logic
1. Red is at 9 VP and could potentially win next turn.
2. I don't have enough resources for any meaningful build right now.
3. Making maritime trades at 4:1 is inefficient and won't enable a significant play.
4. I should save my resources for next turn when I might get more from production.
5. End turn is my best option to preserve resources.

<plan>
1. End turn to preserve resources
2. Hope for good dice rolls to get needed ore and sheep
3. Next turn, prioritize development cards if I get sheep
4. If I get brick, consider settlement placement to increase production
5. Continue working toward largest army (need one more knight)
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 1 | Player: BLUE | Action: BUILD_INITIAL_SETTLEMENT

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. End turn to preserve resources
2. Hope for good dice rolls to get needed ore and sheep
3. Next turn, prioritize development cards if I get sheep
4. If I get brick, consider settlement placement to increase production
5. Continue working toward largest army (need one more knight)

# Initial Settlement Placement Analysis

I need to choose the most strategic location for my very first settlement. Let me analyze the options based on the important factors for initial placement:

## Key Priorities:
1. Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8)
2. Focus on ore and wheat resources
3. Place on intersections of complementary resources
4. Secure at least one good source of each resource or access to ports
5. Consider future expansion potential

## Best Node Analysis:

Looking at the board, I see several high-probability hexes:
- Brick 8 (0,0,0) at nodes 0-5
- Wheat 8 (-1,0,1) at nodes 3,4,12,13,14,15
- Sheep 6 (1,-1,0) at nodes 1,2,6,7,8,9
- Wood 6 (0,-2,2) at nodes 10,11,29,30,31,32

Let me look at intersections with multiple strong resources:

### Node 3: Excellent position
- Connects to Brick 8 (⭐⭐⭐), Wheat 8 (⭐⭐⭐), and Ore 12 (⭐)
- Perfect combination of ore, wheat and brick for development cards and expansion
- Already has Red's settlement at node 4 nearby, but different resources

### Node 10: Very strong position
- Connects to Wood 6 (⭐⭐⭐), Wheat 10 (⭐⭐), and Ore 12 (⭐)
- Good mix of resources needed for both expansions and development cards

### Node 11: Strong position
- Connects to Wood 6 (⭐⭐⭐), Wheat 10 (⭐⭐), and Ore 12 (⭐)
- Similar to node 10 but different expansion directions

### Node 13: Strong position
- Connects to Wood 2 (⭐), Wheat 8 (⭐⭐⭐), and Wheat 10 (⭐⭐)
- Access to wheat port at nodes 32-33
- Double wheat production but low wood probability

After careful analysis, node 3 is clearly the optimal choice. It provides:
1. Access to high-probability Brick 8 and Wheat 8 (both ⭐⭐⭐)
2. Access to Ore 12 (⭐) - critical for city upgrades and development cards
3. Perfect mix of three different resources needed for early game
4. Good expansion potential in multiple directions

<plan>
1. Place first settlement at node 3 to secure key high-probability resources
2. For second settlement, aim for a location with wood/sheep access (complementary to first settlement)
3. Prioritize development card strategy with ore/wheat/sheep from my settlements
4. Early game: Build settlements at strategic nodes for resource diversity
5. Mid game: Focus on city upgrades and development cards
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex

- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Analysis of Initial Road Placement Options

I need to analyze the best option for my initial road placement after establishing my first settlement at node 12. Let me examine each option carefully:

## Option 0: Build road at edge (11, 12)
- Direction: Leads toward node 11, which connects to:
  - 🌾10 tile (-1, -1, 2)
  - 🌲6 tile (0, -2, 2)
  - ⛏️12 tile (0, -1, 1)
- Node 11 would provide access to good production tiles, especially the 6-value wood
- Future expansion possibilities look promising in this direction

## Option 1: Build road at edge (12, 13)
- Direction: Leads toward node 13, which connects to:
  - 🌾10 tile (-1, -1, 2)
  - 🌾8 tile (-1, 0, 1)
  - 🌲2 tile (-2, 0, 2)
- Node 13 would provide additional wheat access, but the wood is only a 2-value hex
- Nearby wheat port at nodes 32-33 could be valuable for wheat trading

## Option 2: Build road at edge (3, 12)
- Direction: Leads toward node 3, which connects to:
  - ⛏️12 tile (0, -1, 1)
  - 🌾8 tile (-1, 0, 1)
  - 🧱8 tile (0, 0, 0)
- Node 3 would provide access to excellent 8-value brick
- This area seems less contested currently

## Strategic Considerations:
1. My first settlement at node 12 already produces wheat (8 & 10) and ore (12)
2. I'm lacking wood, brick, and sheep for balanced production
3. For my development card strategy, I have ore access but need more sheep

Based on my initial plan to focus on development cards, I should prioritize securing sheep access, while also ensuring I have enough wood/brick for essential expansion.

Option 0 leads toward high-probability wood (6) and could potentially connect toward sheep areas. Option 2 leads toward high-value brick (8) that complements my existing resources for expansion.

<plan>
1. Build initial road toward node 3 to secure potential access to 8-value brick
2. Place second settlement at a location with wood and sheep access
3. Prioritize development card strategy with my ore/wheat/sheep resources
4. Early game: Build minimal settlements at strategic nodes for resource diversity
5. Mid game: Focus on city upgrades and development cards
</plan>

For my initial road placement, I choose option 2 (edge 3-12) as it provides the best path toward high-value brick which I'll need for early expansion, while still keeping options open for my second settlement placement to target wood and sheep resources.

# Initial Settlement Placement Analysis

I need to place my second settlement strategically following my development card strategy. Let me analyze the best options:

## Current Status
- I already have a settlement at node 12 which produces wheat (8 - high probability) and ore (12 - low probability) and wheat (10 - medium probability)
- For my development card strategy, I need good sources of ore, wheat, and sheep
- Ideally, I want to cover different resources with high probability numbers

## Key Considerations
1. I should prioritize high-probability numbers (6, 8)
2. I need to secure sheep for my development card strategy
3. I should consider locations with wood or brick to enable building
4. Proximity to useful ports would be beneficial
5. Avoid the robber's current location (2, -1, -1)

## Best Options Analysis

### Node 0: (0,0,0)/(0,1,-1)/(1,0,-1)
- Resources: Brick (8⭐⭐⭐), Brick (3), Wood (4)
- Pros: High probability brick (8), diverse resources
- Cons: Only one strong production number

### Node 1: (0,0,0)/(1,-1,0)/(1,0,-1)
- Resources: Brick (8⭐⭐⭐), Sheep (6⭐⭐), Wood (4)
- Pros: High probability brick, good sheep, wood access
- Cons: No ore or wheat for development card strategy

### Node 5: (0,0,0)/(0,1,-1)/(−1,1,0)
- Resources: Brick (8⭐⭐⭐), Brick (3), Ore (9⭐⭐)
- Pros: High probability brick, access to ore
- Cons: Duplicate brick resource, no sheep

### Node 8: (1,-2,1)/(1,-1,0)/(2,-2,0)
- Resources: Wood (5⭐⭐), Sheep (6⭐⭐), Sheep (4)
- Pros: Good sheep production, wood access
- Cons: No ore or wheat, no high probability (8) tiles

### Node 22: (1,0,-1)/(1,1,-2)/(2,0,-2)
- Resources: Wood (4), Brick (5⭐⭐), Ore (11)
- Pros: Access to ore, brick and wood
- Cons: No sheep, low probability numbers

### Node 20: (0,1,-1)/(1,0,-1)/(1,1,-2)
- Resources: Brick (3), Wood (4), Brick (5⭐⭐)
- Pros: Two brick sources, wood access
- Cons: Low probability numbers, no sheep/wheat/ore for development cards

### Node 27: (1,-2,1)/(2,-2,0)
- Resources: Wood (5⭐⭐), Sheep (4)
- Pros: Near 2:1 wood port (at nodes 28, 29)
- Cons: No ore or wheat, average probabilities

## Decision Logic

Looking at my development card strategy, I need good sources of ore, wheat, and sheep. Since I already have wheat at my first settlement, I should prioritize securing sheep and additional ore.

Node 1 is an excellent choice because:
1. It gives me access to sheep (6 - good probability)
2. It provides brick (8 - excellent probability) for building
3. It adds wood (4) for expansion
4. It complements my current settlement's resources (wheat and ore)
5. It provides resource diversity across my two settlements

<plan>
1. Place second settlement at node 1 to secure sheep and high-probability brick
2. Build roads toward potential ore-rich areas or ports
3. Focus on city upgrades for my wheat/ore settlement
4. Buy development cards when I have sheep/wheat/ore
5. Aim for 3+ victory point cards and largest army bonus
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I'll choose:

\boxed{1}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Analyzing Initial Settlement and Road Placement Strategy

I need to decide where to build my initial road from my settlement at node 1. I'll thoroughly analyze the options considering the board position and my long-term strategy.

## Current Status Assessment:
- I have two settlements: one at node 12 (producing ore, wheat) and one at node 1 (producing brick, sheep, wood)
- My resources: 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 sheep
- I have all resources covered through my settlements, with particularly strong production of wheat, brick, and sheep

## Road Options Analysis:
[0] Build road at edge (0, 1)
- Direction: This connects node 0, linking toward the center of the board
- Nearby resources: Node 0 connects to wood (4), brick (8), and wheat/ore hexes
- Future potential: Gives access to multiple resource types and central board position

[1] Build road at edge (1, 2) 
- Direction: This leads northeast from settlement
- Nearby resources: Continues along sheep (6) and brick (8) hexes
- Future potential: Could eventually lead toward the brick port (nodes 52, 53)

[2] Build road at edge (1, 6)
- Direction: This leads southeast from settlement
- Nearby resources: Along sheep (6) and wood (4) hexes
- Future potential: Could lead toward wood-producing areas and eventually ore (11) hex

## Strategic Considerations:
1. According to my development card strategy, I need good access to ore, wheat, and sheep
2. I already have a settlement with strong wheat/ore production (node 12)
3. Road placement should complement my expansion strategy for additional resources or ports
4. Looking for paths that maximize my flexibility for future settlements

Option [0] provides the most flexibility by moving toward the center of the board, giving access to multiple different resources. This aligns with my plan to expand resource diversity and allow for more strategic options later.

Option [1] heads northeast along resources I already produce well, and would eventually lead to the brick port, which could be useful but not top priority.

Option [2] heads southeast and could eventually lead to ore-producing areas, which complements my strategy to focus on cities and development cards.

<plan>
1. Build initial road toward node 0 to maximize future expansion flexibility
2. Aim for next settlement at a location with strong ore/wheat production
3. Focus on city upgrades for my settlements when I gather sufficient resources
4. Buy development cards when I have excess sheep/wheat/ore
5. Pursue largest army bonus and victory point cards
</plan>

Considering my development card focused strategy and need for flexibility, I'll build the road that gives me the most options for expansion.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze my current game state:
- I have 2 settlements:
  - At node 12: Producing ore (12), wheat (8★★★), and wheat (10★)
  - At node 1: Producing brick (8★★★), sheep (6★★★), and wood (4★)
- My resources: 1 wood, 2 brick, 1 sheep, 2 wheat
- I can build a road this turn with my wood and brick

## Road Building Options Analysis
I need to evaluate which road would offer the best expansion opportunities:

1. Road at edge (1, 2): Expands from settlement at node 1 toward sheep (6★★★)
2. Road at edge (0, 20): Expands from settlement at node 1 toward brick (3) and wheat (9)
3. Road at edge (3, 4): Extends from my settlement at node 12 toward wheat (8★★★)
4. Road at edge (12, 13): Extends from settlement at node 12 toward wheat (10★) and ore (12)
5. Road at edge (2, 3): Connects back toward my settlement at node 12
6. Road at edge (11, 12): Expands from settlement at node 12 toward wheat (10★)
7. Road at edge (0, 5): Expands from settlement at node 1 toward brick (3)
8. Road at edge (1, 6): Expands from settlement at node 1 toward sheep (6★★★) and the desert

## Strategic Evaluation

My current plan focuses on:
1. Expanding for ore/wheat production
2. Aiming for city upgrades
3. Development cards

Looking at my settlements:
- My settlement at node 12 already has excellent wheat production and some ore
- My settlement at node 1 has good brick and sheep, but lacks ore/wheat

For city upgrades, I need ore and wheat. I should prioritize a path that leads to strong ore production or additional wheat.

Edge (12, 13) leads toward another wheat hex (10★) and the same ore hex (12) I already access, potentially allowing me to reach the wheat port (nodes 32, 33).

Edge (3, 4) leads toward the strong wheat hex (8★★★) I'm already accessing, and potentially toward the ore port.

Edge (0, 20) leads toward node 19 which connects to wheat (9) and brick (3, 5).

<plan>
1. Build road toward wheat port (nodes 32, 33) for improved wheat trading
2. Continue expansion toward good ore production or the ore port
3. Purchase development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
4. Upgrade settlements to cities when resources allow, prioritizing settlements with strong production
5. Maintain flexibility to pursue largest army through knight cards
</plan>

After careful analysis, I believe road option 4 (edge 12, 13) offers the best strategic value as it:
1. Moves me toward the wheat port (which complements my strong wheat production)
2. Maintains flexibility for future expansion
3. Aligns with my city-focused strategy by enabling better resource conversion

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 5 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build road toward wheat port (nodes 32, 33) for improved wheat trading

# Game Analysis and Decision

I'll analyze the current game state, my resources, and my available options to determine the optimal action.

## Current Game State Assessment:
- I currently have 2 VP from my two settlements
- My resources: 1 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK, 1 🐑SHEEP, 3 🌾WHEAT
- My settlements are at:
  - Node 12: produces ⛏️12, 🌾8, 🌾10 (strong wheat production but low probability ore)
  - Node 1: produces 🧱8, 🐑6, 🌲4 (good brick and sheep production)
- The robber is currently on a desert hex, so not affecting any resource production

## Resource Analysis:
- Strong in wheat (3 cards + good production)
- Have just enough wood and brick to build one road
- Weak in ore production (only from a 12, which is low probability)
- Have one sheep card

## Strategic Considerations:
1. My current plan includes building toward the wheat port (nodes 32, 33)
2. I need to improve my ore production for cities and development cards
3. I need to expand to new settlement locations to increase my points and resource diversity

## Road Building Options Analysis:

Looking at road options with long-term expansion potential:
1. Edge (13, 14): Extends from my settlement at node 12, moving toward the wheat port (aligns with current plan)
9. Edge (13, 34): Also extends from node 12, alternative path toward wheat port

Looking at paths for my settlement at node 1:
2. Edge (1, 2): Expands from my settlement at node 1
3. Edge (0, 20): Expands from node 1's area in another direction
8. Edge (1, 6): Another expansion from settlement at node 1

The other options seem less strategically valuable as they don't connect directly to my existing infrastructure.

## Decision Logic:

Since my plan prioritizes reaching the wheat port (nodes 32, 33), I should choose between options 1 and 9. Looking at the board connectivity:
- Option 1 (edge 13, 14) moves toward the wheat port via node 14
- Option 9 (edge 13, 34) also moves toward the wheat port via node 34

Reviewing the resource tiles adjacent to these paths:
- Path through node 14 connects to: 🐑3, ⛏️9, 🌾8 hexes
- Path through node 34 connects to: 🌾10, 🌲2 hexes

Given that I already have strong wheat production but weak ore production, the path through node 14 is more attractive as it could potentially lead to better ore access (⛏️9 hex).

<plan>
1. Build road at edge (13, 14) toward wheat port and potentially improve ore access
2. Continue expansion toward good ore production (⛏️9 hex)
3. Purchase development cards when excess sheep/wheat/ore are available
4. Aim for settlement at a node with good ore production
5. Upgrade settlements to cities prioritizing high wheat/ore production
</plan>

I choose to build a road at edge (13, 14) to progress toward the wheat port while positioning myself for improved ore access.

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and my available options:

## Current Resources:
- 1 🌲WOOD
- 1 🧱BRICK
- 1 🐑SHEEP
- 4 🌾WHEAT

## Production:
- Settlement at node 12: ⛏️12 (low probability), 🌾8 (good), 🌾10 (low)
- Settlement at node 1: 🧱8 (good), 🐑6 (good), 🌲4 (low)

## Available Actions:
1. Build a road (I have exactly the resources needed: 1 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK)
2. Build a settlement at node 14 (Need: 1 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 🐑SHEEP - which I have)
3. Maritime trade (suboptimal with my current resources)
4. End turn

## Settlement Option Analysis:

Node 14 would connect to:
- 🌲2 (very low probability)
- 🌾8 (good probability)
- ⛏️9 (good probability)

This would give me additional production of:
- Wood (low probability)
- Wheat (already have good production)
- Ore (good probability, which I need for city upgrades and development cards)

Furthermore, node 14 is adjacent to the wheat port (nodes 32, 33), which would be valuable since I produce wheat well.

## Strategic Considerations:

1. Building a settlement now would give me:
   - Immediate +1 VP (bringing me to 3/10)
   - New ore production (⛏️9) which is critical for city upgrades
   - Another wheat hex (already producing well)
   - Position near the wheat port

2. Building just a road would:
   - Save resources for potential development card next turn
   - Not give immediate VP gain

A settlement provides both VP and resource production, making it far more valuable than just building a road or saving resources. The location at node 14 is particularly strong as it gives me access to ore (⛏️9) which I currently lack good production for, plus positions me near the wheat port.

<plan>
1. Build settlement at node 14 to gain ore production and position near wheat port
2. Focus on gathering ore/wheat for city upgrades and development cards
3. Use wheat port to convert excess wheat to needed resources
4. Target upgrading settlements to cities, prioritizing high wheat/ore production
5. Continue expansion toward ore port or other valuable resource nodes
</plan>

The settlement at node 14 aligns perfectly with my development card strategy as it will provide the ore I need. This is the optimal play in this position.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

RESPONSE:
# Robber Placement Analysis

I'll analyze the game state to determine the optimal robber placement that gives me the best strategic advantage.

## Current Situation
- I'm playing as BLUE with 3 victory points
- Red also has 3 victory points, making us tied
- I have 1 Wood and 3 Wheat resources
- I need to move the robber from its current location (2, -1, -1)

## Strategic Priorities for Robber Placement
1. Target RED's most productive hexes
2. Choose hexes where I can steal a useful resource
3. Minimize impact on my own production
4. Block resources RED needs for upcoming builds

## Analyzing RED's Production
- RED has settlements at nodes 4, 8, and 17
- Key producing hexes:
  - Brick 8 (⭐⭐⭐) at (0, 0, 0)
  - Wheat 8 (⭐⭐⭐) at (-1, 0, 1)
  - Sheep 6 (⭐⭐⭐) at (1, -1, 0)
  - Ore 9 (⭐⭐) at (-1, 1, 0)

## Best Robber Placement Options

### Option 0: Move to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED
- This blocks the Brick 8 hex, which is RED's excellent Brick source
- Brick is crucial for expansion through road building
- This helps prevent RED from building roads to expand

### Option 1: Move to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED
- This blocks the Sheep 6 hex, which is one of RED's best sheep sources
- Limits RED's ability to buy development cards

### Option 3: Move to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED
- This blocks the Wheat 8 hex, which is RED's excellent Wheat source
- Wheat is critical for settlements, cities, and development cards
- This is a high-impact move to slow RED's progress

### Option 4: Move to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED
- This blocks the Ore 9 hex
- Ore is essential for cities and development cards
- This can slow RED's progression toward city upgrades

## Considering My Own Resources and Plans
- I have Wheat production from multiple sources
- I need to diversify my resources for future builds
- Blocking RED's key production while stealing a useful resource is key

## Final Decision
Option 0 (move robber to Brick 8 hex) will significantly impact RED's ability to expand through roads while not affecting my own production. Brick is a critical resource for RED's expansion strategy, and stealing a card could give me a resource I need.

<plan>
1. Block RED's brick production with robber placement
2. Continue gathering wheat and ore for city upgrades
3. Focus on development card purchases when sheep becomes available
4. Look for opportunities to build toward the ore port
5. Prioritize city upgrades at high production settlements

- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 11 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Block RED's brick production with robber placement
2. Continue gathering wheat and ore for city upgrades
3. Focus on development card purchases when sheep becomes available
4. Look for opportunities to build toward the ore port
5. Prioritize city upgrades at high production settlements
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis for Turn 11

Let me analyze the current game state and available options:

## Current Resources
- I have 1 🌲WOOD and 4 🌾WHEAT
- No development cards

## Victory Point Status
- I have 3 VP from 3 settlements
- RED also has 3 VP from 3 settlements
- Neither of us has longest road or largest army

## Key Observations
- The robber is currently on the brick hex (0,0,0) which is one of my production hexes
- I cannot build anything significant with my current resources:
  - Settlement requires 1🌲 1🧱 1🐑 1🌾 (missing brick and sheep)
  - City requires 2🌾 3⛏️ (missing ore)
  - Development card requires 1🐑 1🌾 1⛏️ (missing sheep and ore)
  - Road requires 1🌲 1🧱 (missing brick)

## Action Analysis
1. **End Turn (Action 0)** - This saves my resources for next turn's potential builds
2. **Maritime Trade (Actions 1-4)** - All options involve trading 4 wheat for 1 resource:
   - This is inefficient compared to standard port rates (3:1) or resource-specific ports (2:1)
   - I would be left with 0 wheat and still not have enough resources to build anything meaningful

## Strategic Considerations
- Wheat is one of my strong production resources (two settlements on wheat:8)
- Trading 4 wheat away would deplete a key resource that I need for city upgrades
- If I roll a 7 next turn with 5+ cards, I'll lose half my resources
- However, with only 5 total resources currently, I'm safe from discarding
- My best bet is to accumulate more resources next turn to make a meaningful build

<plan>
1. End turn to preserve wheat for city upgrades
2. Watch RED's moves and continue blocking their brick production if needed
3. Next turn, aim to:
   - Build toward ore port if I get wood + brick
   - Buy development card if I get sheep + ore
   - Upgrade to city if I get 2 more ore (total of 3)
4. Long-term, focus on city upgrades as they provide the best VP-to-resource ratio
</plan>

Since I can't make any productive builds or trades with my current resources, and trading away my wheat at a 4:1 ratio would be inefficient, the best option is to end my turn and preserve my resources for future opportunities.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources

# Analyzing Robber Placement Options

I need to carefully evaluate where to move the robber to maximize my advantage while hindering RED player who is my main competitor.

## Analysis of Key Factors:
1. The robber is currently on (0,0,0) which is a brick hex with value 8 - a prime production spot
2. RED has settlements on high-value hexes, including:
   - Node 4: Produces brick-8(★★★), wheat-8(★★★), ore-9(★★)
   - Node 8: Produces sheep-6(★★★), sheep-4(★), wood-5(★★)
   - Node 17: Produces ore-9(★★), sheep-3(★), wheat-11(★)
3. I have 1 wood and 6 wheat but need more ore to build cities (my goal)
4. RED has 1 hidden resource card that I could potentially steal

## Best Robber Placement Options:

### Option [2] - Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED
- This is a wheat-8(★★★) hex
- Blocks one of RED's best production spots at node 4
- Blocks one of my wheat production at node 12, but I already have 6 wheat cards
- I can steal from RED who might have brick, ore or sheep

### Option [3] - Move robber to (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED
- This is an ore-9(★★) hex
- Blocks RED's ore production at nodes 4 and 17
- Doesn't block any of my resource production
- I can steal from RED and potentially get ore which I need

### Option [0] - Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED
- This is a sheep-6(★★★) hex
- Blocks RED's sheep production at node 8
- Blocks my sheep production at node 1, but I don't have sheep currently
- I can steal from RED

## Strategic Decision:
Option [3] provides the most value because:
1. It targets ore-9, a valuable resource I need for cities
2. Blocks RED's production at two nodes (4 and 17)
3. Doesn't block any of my own resource production
4. Gives me a chance to steal from RED, potentially gaining ore

<plan>
1. Block RED's ore production with robber and try to steal ore
2. Use my wheat to either buy a development card or upgrade to a city once I get the necessary ore
3. Continue focusing on city upgrades for efficient VP generation
4. Consider building toward the ore port (nodes 48-49) if I gain wood+brick resources

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 13 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Block RED's ore production with robber and try to steal ore
2. Use my wheat to either buy a development card or upgrade to a city once I get the necessary ore
3. Continue focusing on city upgrades for efficient VP generation
4. Consider building toward the ore port (nodes 48-49) if I gain wood+brick resources
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis for Turn 13

I need to evaluate my position and available options carefully:

## Current Resource Assessment
- I have 1 🌲WOOD and 7 🌾WHEAT
- I'm lacking ORE, SHEEP, and BRICK for any immediate builds

## Victory Point Status
- I have 3/10 VP (all from settlements)
- RED also has 3/10 VP (all from settlements)
- We're tied in the race

## Strategic Options Analysis
1. **End Turn**: Simply ending my turn preserves my resources but doesn't advance my position.
2. **Maritime Trade**: I could trade 4 WHEAT for another resource, but this is very inefficient.

Let me analyze the maritime trade options:
- Trading for WOOD isn't helpful since I already have 1 WOOD
- Trading for SHEEP would get me one step closer to a development card (need ORE+WHEAT+SHEEP)
- Trading for ORE would get me one step closer to a city upgrade (need 3 ORE+2 WHEAT)
- Trading for BRICK would allow me to build a road, but that doesn't immediately help my VP total

## Risk Assessment
I have 7 WHEAT cards, which means I'll lose resources if a 7 is rolled on the next turn. This is a significant risk.

## Strategic Plan Evaluation
My current plan involves city upgrades and potentially development cards. I need ORE for both strategies.

Looking at the board:
- The robber is already on an ore hex, impacting RED's production
- I need to generate ORE somehow, and my ORE production is limited to just one hex with a low-probability number (12)
- I should consider maritime trade to convert my excess WHEAT

<plan>
1. Use maritime trade to convert some WHEAT to resources I need
2. Continue focusing on acquiring ORE for city upgrades (3 ORE + 2 WHEAT)
3. Consider development cards as an alternative path (1 ORE + 1 WHEAT + 1 SHEEP)
4. Look for opportunities to expand toward the ore port (nodes 48-49) to improve my trading options
</plan>

## Decision
While a 4:1 trade is inefficient, I have excess WHEAT that I risk losing if a 7 is rolled. Trading some WHEAT for ORE aligns with my city upgrade strategy. This will give me 1 ORE, and I'll still have 3 WHEAT left, keeping me below the 7-card threshold for losing cards to the robber.

# Game Analysis for Turn 15

Let me analyze my current position and available options:

## Current Resource Assessment
- I have: 1 WOOD, 1 SHEEP, 4 WHEAT, 1 ORE
- My settlements produce: SHEEP, WHEAT, ORE, WOOD, BRICK (good diversity)
- Current VP: 3/10 (same as RED)

## Available Actions Analysis
0. End turn - Not optimal when I can make a productive move
1. Buy development card (1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE) - This aligns with development card strategy
2-5. Maritime trades - Trading 4:1 WHEAT for other resources is inefficient

## Strategic Considerations

**Development Card Analysis:**
- Development cards can provide:
  - Victory points (25% chance)
  - Knights (can help gain Largest Army = 2 VP)
  - Resource advantages (Year of Plenty, Monopoly)
- Currently no player has Largest Army (0 knights)
- Development cards provide hidden strength, making me less of a target

**Resource Position:**
- I have 4 WHEAT which is more than I need right now
- I have exactly enough resources for a development card (1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE)
- Maritime trading at 4:1 is inefficient - better to use my resources for development

**Long-term Strategy:**
- Development cards align with my primary win path (cities + largest army)
- I should focus on acquiring ore for city upgrades after this move
- Maritime trading would deplete my WHEAT without significant benefit

<plan>
1. Buy development card now (may be VP or knight to start largest army)
2. Focus on acquiring ORE for city upgrades (3 ORE + 2 WHEAT)
3. If I get a knight, work toward largest army (2 VP)
4. Look to expand toward the ore port (nodes 48-49) to improve my trading options
</plan>

Buying a development card is the optimal move. It could provide a victory point, knight for largest army, or utility cards for future advantage. This fits with my high-level strategy of using development cards as a path to victory. The 4:1 maritime trades are inefficient, and ending my turn without action would be wasteful.

- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current state of the game:

1. **Resources**: I have 1 wood, 1 brick, 5 wheat, and a knight card.
2. **Victory Points**: I have 3 VP (from 3 settlements).
3. **Opponent**: Red also has 3 VP and 3 hidden resource cards.
4. **Robber**: Currently on the ore hex (-1, 1, 0) with dice number 9, affecting my settlement at node 12.
5. **My Production**:
   - Settlement at node 12: Wheat (8), Wheat (10), Ore (12) - but ore is unreliable (12) and currently blocked by robber (9)
   - Settlement at node 1: Brick (8), Sheep (6), Wood (4)
   - Settlement at node 14: Wheat (8), Wood (2), Sheep (3)
   - Strong in wheat, weak in ore

## Decision Analysis

I have two options:
1. **Play my Knight card**: This would move the robber off my ore production hex and allow me to steal a resource from Red.
2. **Roll the dice**: Continue normal turn progression.

### Option 1: Play Knight
- **Pros**:
  - Unblocks my ore hex (9) which is crucial for city upgrades
  - Steals a resource from Red
  - Starts my path toward Largest Army (2 VP)
  - Protects me from potential resource loss if I roll a 7
- **Cons**:
  - Uses up my knight without knowing what I'll roll

### Option 2: Roll First
- **Pros**:
  - Could get more resources before deciding to use the knight
  - Might not need to use the knight if I roll favorably
- **Cons**:
  - Risk rolling a 7 with 7 cards in hand (would lose half)
  - My ore production remains blocked

## Strategic Evaluation

Since I have 7 resource cards (1 wood, 1 brick, 5 wheat), rolling a 7 would force me to discard half my cards. This is a significant risk.

More importantly, my ore production is currently blocked by the robber, and I need ore to build cities according to my development card strategy. The robber is directly hindering my path to victory.

Playing the knight now would:
1. Protect my resources from a potential 7
2. Unblock my ore production
3. Allow me to steal a resource from Red
4. Begin my path toward Largest Army (2 VP)

<plan>
1. Play knight card now to unblock ore and start largest army
2. Place robber on Red's best hex (probably the 8 brick/ore) and steal a resource
3. Roll dice and collect production
4. Focus on city upgrades (need ore) or buy development card if I get ore
5. Continue working toward largest army through more development cards
</plan>

Given my resources (7 cards) and the blocked ore hex, playing the knight card before rolling is clearly the optimal move.

❓ Select action by number (0-17):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I need to decide where to place the robber to maximize my strategic advantage. Let me analyze the game state and robber placement options carefully.

First, I'll identify Red's most valuable resource hexes:
- Brick 8 (0,0,0): High value (⭐⭐⭐) - produces for Red's settlement at node 4
- Wheat 8 (-1,0,1): High value (⭐⭐⭐) - produces for Red's settlement at node 4
- Sheep 6 (1,-1,0): High value (⭐⭐⭐) - produces for Red's settlement at node 8

Our current plan focuses on getting ore for city upgrades and development cards for largest army. Red's settlement at node 4 is particularly productive, getting both 8-value resources (brick and wheat). Blocking this settlement would significantly hamper Red's production.

Since I'm running low on resources (only 1 wood, 1 brick, and 5 wheat), I need to disrupt Red's production while potentially gaining resources I need through stealing. I'm especially short on ore, which I need for cities and development cards.

Looking at my options:
- Option [0]: Block Red's 8-value brick at (0,0,0) - this hits one of Red's most productive hexes
- Option [3]: Block Red's 8-value wheat at (-1,0,1) - another high-value hex for Red

Option [0] is particularly strong because:
1. It blocks a high-probability (8) brick hex that Red's settlement at node 4 benefits from
2. It allows me to steal from Red, potentially getting ore which I need
3. Since I already have brick, blocking brick production is more valuable to me than blocking wheat

<plan>
1. Place robber on Red's 8-value brick hex to block their production
2. Next turn, focus on buying development cards if I get ore
3. Continue working toward largest army (2 VP)
4. Look for opportunities to upgrade settlements to cities (ore+wheat)
5. Calculate best expansion path after securing largest army
</plan>

After careful analysis, I will place the robber on Red's high-value brick hex.

   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 17 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Place robber on Red's 8-value brick hex to block their production
2. Next turn, focus on buying development cards if I get ore
3. Continue working toward largest army (2 VP)
4. Look for opportunities to upgrade settlements to cities (ore+wheat)
5. Calculate best expansion path after securing largest army
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

RESPONSE:
# Game Analysis - Settlers of Catan Turn 17

I'll analyze the current game state and determine the best action:

## Current Resources
- 1 Wood
- 1 Brick
- 1 Sheep
- 5 Wheat
- 0 Ore

## Victory Points Status
- I have 3 VP (3 settlements)
- Red has 3 VP (3 settlements)
- Even game, with potential for hidden development cards

## Strategic Options Analysis

1. **Build a Road (Actions 1-10)**
   - I have exactly the resources needed (1 wood, 1 brick)
   - This would extend my network for future settlement locations
   - Good positioning could set up for longest road (2 VP)

2. **Trade Resources (Actions 11-14)**
   - Trading 4 wheat for ore would let me buy a development card
   - Development cards align with my current plan (largest army)
   - I currently have 5 wheat, making this trade possible

3. **End Turn (Action 0)**
   - Save resources for next turn
   - Risk losing cards if a 7 is rolled (I have 8 cards total)

## Road Building Analysis
Looking at road options, I should evaluate which gives the best expansion potential:
- Building at edge (14, 37) connects to node 37, which borders wood(2), sheep(3), and has access to a 3:1 port
- Building at edge (13, 34) connects to node 34, which borders wood(2), wheat(10), and wheat port
- Other options are less strategic for expansion

## Resource Management
- I have 8 cards, which puts me at risk if 7 is rolled
- Having 5 wheat is excessive - I should convert this to something useful

## Decision Making

The optimal move is to trade 4 wheat for 1 ore (Action 13) for these reasons:
1. Reduces my hand size from 8 to 5 cards, protecting against the robber
2. Allows me to buy a development card next turn (ore + wheat + sheep)
3. Supports my plan of pursuing largest army
4. Development cards offer hidden victory points or useful actions
5. I'll still have 1 wheat remaining for future builds

<plan>
1. Trade wheat for ore now to reduce hand size
2. Buy development card next turn (hopefully get victory point or knight)
3. Continue working toward largest army (2 VP)
4. Look for opportunities to upgrade settlements to cities when more ore is available
5. Build roads strategically toward good settlement spots when resources permit
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}

- I currently have 3 VP from my 3 settlements
- I have played 1 knight card, need 2 more for largest army (2 VP)
- I have no visible path to longest road currently

## Strategic Analysis

### Option: End Turn
- Pros: Save resources for future options, potentially accumulate more
- Cons: No immediate progress, risk holding cards through others' turns and potential 7 rolls

### Option: Build a Road
- Pros: Extends my network for future settlement locations, potential for longest road
- Cons: Uses wood and brick which I'll need for settlements, doesn't directly gain VPs

### Option: Buy a Development Card
- Pros: 
  - Could get a VP card (immediate hidden progress)
  - Could get a knight (progress toward largest army)
  - Could get a resource card (Year of Plenty/Monopoly) for tactical advantage
  - Uses sheep, wheat and ore which aligns with my city-focused strategy
- Cons:
  - Random draw, might not get what I need
  - Can't use the card this turn (except VP cards)

## Decision Process
Looking at my current plan of focusing on development cards for largest army and hidden VPs, buying a development card makes the most sense. I have exactly the resources needed, and this continues my strategic path.

The road building options would deplete my brick and wood, making it harder to establish new settlements in good locations when I find them. I'd prefer to save those resources.

Since I have 5 cards total, I'm at risk of losing half if someone rolls a 7, so making a move that reduces my hand size is prudent.

<plan>
1. Buy development card this turn to potentially get VP card or knight
2. Continue working toward largest army (2 VP)
3. If I get resource cards (Year of Plenty/Monopoly), use them strategically to support city upgrades
4. Look for opportunities to get more ore and wheat for city upgrades
5. Build roads and settlements only when highly advantageous or when I have excess resources
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I choose to buy a development card:

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

❓ Select action by number (0-10):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I need to analyze the game state carefully and determine the optimal action for this turn.

## Current Situation Analysis

1. **My Resources**: 1 wood, 1 brick
2. **My Victory Points**: 3 VP from settlements
3. **Development Cards**: 1 knight card already played, contributing towards largest army
4. **Building Options**: I can only build a road with my current resources

## Strategic Considerations

1. **Development Card Strategy**: My current plan prioritizes development cards, but I don't have the resources (sheep, wheat, ore) needed to purchase one.
2. **Largest Army**: I have 1 knight played - need 2 more to get largest army.
3. **Road Building**: I have exactly the resources needed for 1 road. I need to determine if this advances my position meaningfully.
4. **Resource Production**: I have good wheat production from 🌾8 (appears twice in my settlements), but I'm weak on ore, which is critical for cities and development cards.

## Road Placement Options Analysis

I should build a road that:
- Opens up valuable settlement spots for future expansion
- Potentially leads toward a port that complements my resource production
- Gives me access to resources I'm lacking (primarily ore)
- Could contribute to longest road in the future

Looking at my options:
- Edge (14, 37): Moves toward a 3:1 port and could eventually give me access to more wood from 🌲2
- Edge (13, 34): Moves toward a wheat port (which could be valuable given my wheat production) and wheat hex 🌾10
- Edge (3, 4): Moves toward ore production on ⛏️9
- Edge (2, 3): Doesn't open immediate valuable options
- Edge (0, 5): Could eventually lead toward the ore hex ⛏️11 or brick 🧱3
- Edge (1, 6): Moves toward sheep production 🐑6

Given my resource needs and current settlements, I should prioritize getting access to more ore for development cards and cities.

## Decision

I believe building a road at edge (3, 4) is the best option as it positions me to potentially place a settlement that would give me access to ore production from ⛏️9, which I critically need for my development card strategy. This hex is currently being used by Red, so getting access would both increase my production and potentially limit theirs.

<plan>
1. Build road toward ore production this turn
2. Save resources for development cards when I get ore/wheat/sheep
3. Continue working toward largest army (2 VP)
4. Look to place a settlement to access ⛏️9 for ore production
5. Progress toward city upgrades once ore production is secured

- The robber is currently on the 🧱8 hex (0,0,0), which is a high-value hex
- My 1st settlement (node 12) produces: ⛏️12, 🌾8[⭐⭐⭐], 🌾10[⭐]
- My 2nd settlement (node 1) produces: 🧱8[⭐⭐⭐], 🐑6[⭐⭐⭐], 🌲4[⭐]
- My 3rd settlement (node 14) produces: 🌾8[⭐⭐⭐], 🌲2, 🐑3[⭐]

## Key Observations
1. The robber is on the 🧱8 hex, which is a high-value production hex (triple star)
2. This hex is connected to my settlement at node 1, blocking my brick production
3. I only have 1 WHEAT resource, not enough to build anything after rolling
4. I have a KNIGHT card that could move the robber and possibly steal a resource
5. RED has 3 cards, giving me a chance to steal a useful resource by playing the KNIGHT

## My Options

**Option 0: Play KNIGHT card**
- Pros:
  - Remove the robber from the 🧱8 hex that's blocking my brick production
  - Steal a resource from RED (who has 3 cards)
  - Move toward "Largest Army" (I'd have 2 knights played, needing 1 more)
  - Improve my position before rolling, potentially gaining more resources
- Cons:
  - Use up a defensive card that might be needed later

**Option 1: Roll the dice**
- Pros:
  - Might get resources needed for development
  - Save the KNIGHT card for later defensive use
- Cons:
  - The robber remains on my 🧱8 resource, continuing to block production
  - If I roll a 7, I would have to move the robber anyway without the benefit of the KNIGHT

## Strategic Considerations

The current plan involves building toward ore production and continuing to work toward largest army. Playing the KNIGHT card directly advances both goals by:
1. Moving closer to Largest Army (now at 2/3 knights needed)
2. Removing blockage from a resource hex that could help me build toward ore
3. Possibly stealing a valuable resource from RED

<plan>
1. Play knight to unblock my brick production and move toward largest army
2. Place robber on a high-value hex for RED (probably 🧱8 or ⛏️9)
3. Continue building roads toward ore production (⛏️9 hex)
4. Save resources for development cards to secure largest army
5. Look to place settlement near ore production
6. Upgrade to cities once ore production is secure
</plan>

Given the analysis, playing the KNIGHT card provides immediate tactical advantages and aligns with my strategic goals.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

RESPONSE:
# Game Analysis: Robber Placement Decision

I need to determine the most strategic placement for the robber to maximize my win chances while hindering my opponent.

## Game State Summary
- I'm playing BLUE with 3 victory points (3 settlements)
- RED also has 3 victory points
- I have played 2 knights, getting closer to Largest Army (2 VP)
- The robber is currently on 🧱8 (0,0,0)
- I have only 1 wheat resource card

## Robber Placement Analysis

First, I need to identify RED's most valuable production hexes:
- 🧱8 (current robber location): High-value brick production
- 🌾8: High-value wheat production
- ⛏️9: Good ore production at two settlements
- 🐑6: Good sheep production

Looking at RED's settlements:
- Node 4: Produces 🧱8, 🌾8, ⛏️9 - this is extremely valuable!
- Node 8: Produces 🐑6, 🐑4, 🌲5 - good sheep and wood
- Node 17: Produces ⛏️9, 🐑3, 🌾11 - secondary ore source

My settlement at node 12 also benefits from 🌾8, so I should avoid blocking that.

From the options, I should target:
1. RED's highest value hex that I don't share
2. A hex that allows me to steal from RED

Looking at hex (-1,1,0) = ⛏️9:
- This is a valuable ore hex with 9 (good probability)
- RED has two settlements benefiting from it (nodes 4 and 17)
- I don't produce from this hex
- I can steal from RED
- This will hamper RED's ability to get ore for development cards and cities

<plan>
1. Move robber to ⛏️9 hex to block RED's ore production
2. Continue building roads toward good settlement locations
3. Save resources for development cards to secure largest army (already have 2 knights)
4. Target settlement spots with ore production
5. Upgrade to cities when possible with ore/wheat
</plan>

Placing the robber on ⛏️9 (option 3) is optimal because:
- It blocks a valuable resource I don't produce
- It targets RED's production at two settlements
- It lets me steal a card from RED
- It aligns with my development card strategy by limiting RED's access to ore

# Game Analysis

Let me carefully analyze the current game state and available options.

## Current Situation
- I have 3 VP (from 3 settlements)
- Resources: 1 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK, 4 🌾WHEAT
- Already played 2 knights (need 1 more for largest army)
- Robber is currently on ⛏️9 hex, blocking RED's ore production (which is good)

## Options Analysis
1. **End Turn** - Not optimal as I can make a move with my resources.

2. **Build Road** - I have 1 wood and 1 brick, which is exactly what's needed to build a road. Let me evaluate road placement options:
   - Need to determine which road placement leads toward valuable settlement spots or continues my path to longest road.
   - Looking at the map, I need to identify where expansion opportunities exist.

3. **Maritime Trade** - I can trade 4 wheat for other resources, but that's expensive and I already have the wood and brick needed for a road.

## Strategic Priorities
1. **Development Cards**: The plan mentioned focusing on development cards to get largest army (2 VP), but I don't have ore to buy development cards right now.
2. **Settlements**: The plan mentions targeting settlement spots with ore production.
3. **Roads**: Building roads toward good settlement locations.

## Road Placement Analysis
- Road option #1 (edge 1, 2) - Leads toward the 🌾8 and 🧱8 intersection, but RED already has a settlement at node 8.
- Road option #5 (edge 14, 37) - Expands toward the 3:1 port at node 35/36 and toward the 🌲2 resource.
- Road option #8 (edge 14, 15) - Builds toward RED's settlement at node 17, potentially blocking their expansion.
- Road option #9 (edge 13, 34) - Builds toward the 2:1 🌾WHEAT port at nodes 32/33, which complements my wheat production.

Looking at the options, road option #9 (building at edge 13, 34) seems most strategic. This would:
1. Move me toward the wheat port (2:1), which aligns with my strong wheat production
2. Create a path toward node 34, which could be a future settlement location
3. Potentially extend my road network for longest road bonus (2 VP) later

<plan>
1. Build road toward wheat port (edge 13, 34)
2. Continue saving wheat and looking for ore for development cards
3. Aim for settlement at node 34 to access wheat port
4. Keep focus on largest army (need 1 more knight)
5. Upgrade settlements to cities when possible
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I will build a road at edge (13, 34).

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis and Decision

I need to analyze the current game state to determine my optimal move.

## Current Position Analysis
- I have 3 VP from my 3 settlements
- I've played 2 knights, needing just 1 more for Largest Army (2 VP)
- I have 4 wheat, but no other resources
- Resources I produce: Wheat (good), Brick (good), Sheep (moderate), Ore (poor), Wood (poor)
- The robber is currently on an ore hex (-1,1,0) which isn't blocking any of my production
- I have a clear plan to build toward the wheat port at node 34

## Available Actions Assessment
0. End Turn - Simply pass with 4 wheat in hand
1-4. Trade 4 wheat for another resource (wood, sheep, ore, or brick)

## Resource Evaluation
- I need more ore for development cards (primary strategy) and city upgrades
- I have no development cards in hand, and I've committed to the largest army strategy
- Trading for ore would let me buy a development card on a future turn

## Strategy Considerations
Looking at my current plan, I'm focused on:
1. Building toward the wheat port
2. Getting the largest army (need 1 more knight)
3. Upgrading to cities
4. Building a settlement at node 34

With 4 wheat in hand, I can't build anything directly. My best move is to trade for ore, which aligns with both my development card strategy and city upgrade path.

<plan>
1. Trade wheat for ore to prepare for development card purchase
2. On future turns with sheep+wheat+ore, buy development card hoping for knight
3. Continue building toward wheat port at node 34
4. Focus on largest army (need 1 more knight)
5. Upgrade settlements to cities when possible
</plan>

The most strategic action is to trade my wheat for ore:

# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to carefully analyze the game state to decide where to place the robber. Let's think about this systematically.

## Current Game State
- I have 3 VP (3 settlements)
- RED has 5 VP (3 settlements + 2 VP for longest road)
- I've played 2 knight cards (1 more needed for largest army)
- Resources: 1 brick, 1 sheep, 2 wheat, 2 ore

## Strategic Options

When placing the robber, I should:
1. Block RED's most valuable resources
2. Target hexes where I can steal useful resources
3. Minimize impact on my own production
4. Consider long-term strategic implications

Let's analyze RED's settlements and their production:
- Node 4: Produces brick-8 (⭐⭐⭐), wheat-8 (⭐⭐⭐), ore-9 (⭐⭐)
- Node 8: Produces sheep-6 (⭐⭐⭐), sheep-4 (⭐), wood-5 (⭐⭐)
- Node 17: Produces ore-9 (⭐⭐), sheep-3 (⭐), wheat-11 (⭐)

The most productive hexes for RED are:
- Brick-8 at (0,0,0) - high probability and triple production (⭐⭐⭐)
- Wheat-8 at (-1,0,1) - high probability and triple production (⭐⭐⭐)
- Ore-9 at (-1,1,0) - good probability but currently blocked by robber
- Sheep-6 at (1,-1,0) - good probability and triple production (⭐⭐⭐)

The robber is currently on ore-9 at (-1,1,0), so I should relocate it to a more impactful hex.

## Best Placement Options

1. Option [0]: Brick-8 at (0,0,0)
   - Blocks RED's triple-production brick
   - Brick is critical for road building and RED has longest road
   - Allows me to steal from RED
   - Impact: Severely limits RED's road expansion

2. Option [3]: Wheat-8 at (-1,0,1)
   - Blocks RED's triple-production wheat
   - Wheat is critical for settlements and development cards
   - Allows me to steal from RED
   - Impact: Limits RED's ability to expand or buy development cards

3. Option [1]: Sheep-6 at (1,-1,0)
   - Blocks RED's triple-production sheep
   - Sheep is needed for development cards
   - Allows me to steal from RED
   - Impact: Limits RED's ability to buy development cards

## Decision Analysis

Looking at my plan, I need knights for largest army and possibly development cards for VPs. Blocking wheat would limit RED's ability to buy development cards while also potentially allowing me to steal wheat.

However, since RED has longest road and needs brick to extend it further, placing the robber on the brick-8 hex seems most strategic. This would hamper RED's road building while potentially allowing me to steal brick that I can use for my own road expansion.

Between these options, blocking brick at (0,0,0) provides the greatest strategic advantage, as it directly attacks RED's position of strength (longest road) while potentially providing me with brick I need.

<plan>
1. Block RED's brick production to limit their road building
2. Continue accumulating ore/wheat/sheep for development cards
3. Build toward wheat port at node 34
4. Focus on largest army (need 1 more knight)
5. Upgrade settlements to cities when possible
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:

- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game State Analysis

Let me carefully analyze the current game state and my resources to determine the optimal action.

## Current Victory Points Assessment
- I have 3 VP (3 settlements)
- RED has 5 VP (3 settlements + 2 VP for Longest Road)
- I need 7 more VP to win

## My Resource Assessment
- 1 🧱 BRICK
- 1 🐑 SHEEP
- 3 🌾 WHEAT
- 2 ⛏️ ORE
- Total: 7 resources

## Available Actions
- [0] End turn
- [1] Buy development card (costs 1 🐑, 1 🌾, 1 ⛏️)

## Development Card Analysis
If I buy a development card, I will have:
- 0 resources remaining for trades/builds next turn
- Possibilities in the development card draw:
  - Victory Point card (25% chance) - immediate hidden progress
  - Knight card (50% chance) - would give me 3 knights total, securing Largest Army (2 VP)
  - Year of Plenty/Monopoly/Road Building (25% chance) - tactical advantages

## Strategic Considerations
1. I already have 2 knights played. One more would give me Largest Army (2 VP).
2. RED is ahead with 5 VP and has Longest Road.
3. My current plan involves blocking RED's brick production and focusing on largest army.
4. With 7 resources in hand, I'm vulnerable to losing half my resources if a 7 is rolled.

Looking at my current plan, securing Largest Army is a priority. With 2 knights already played, getting one more would give me 2 VP (bringing me to 5 VP total). Even if I get a different card, it could still be valuable.

<plan>
1. Continue development card strategy to secure Largest Army (need 1 more knight)
2. Block RED's brick production with robber when possible
3. Build toward wheat port at node 34 for more efficient trading
4. Upgrade settlements to cities when I have enough ore and wheat
5. Continue buying development cards to find victory point cards
</plan>

Given that:
- I'm at risk of losing resources to a 7 roll with 7 cards
- Buying a development card aligns with my strategy of pursuing Largest Army
- I have exactly the resources needed for a development card
- Any development card drawn will be valuable

The optimal action is to buy a development card.

# Game Analysis for Turn 29

I'll analyze the current game state and my options to determine the best move.

## Current Game State
- I have 3 VP (3 settlements)
- RED has 5 VP (3 settlements + 2 VP for longest road)
- I have 2 knights played, need 1 more for Largest Army (2 VP)
- Resources: 1 BRICK, 1 SHEEP, 2 WHEAT, 1 ORE
- Development cards: 1 YEAR_OF_PLENTY

## Strategic Assessment
Looking at my current situation:
- I need to reach 10 VP, currently at 3 VP
- I could gain 2 VP by getting Largest Army (need 1 more knight)
- I need 5 more VP through cities (2 VP each) and/or victory point cards

The robber is on the brick hex (0,0,0), blocking RED's brick production. This is good as it aligns with my plan to limit RED's expansion.

## Year of Plenty Options
I have the option to play my Year of Plenty card now. This would let me take any two resources from the bank. The key question is: what resources would help me most right now?

To buy a development card, I need: 1 ORE + 1 WHEAT + 1 SHEEP
I currently have: 1 ORE + 2 WHEAT + 1 SHEEP

With Year of Plenty, I could get the resources needed for a development card, which might be a knight (giving me Largest Army) or a victory point card.

Option 0 (take 2 ORE) would be useful for a city in the future, but doesn't help for immediate development card purchase.

## Decision Logic
My development card strategy is working well. I already have 2 knights played, and getting a third knight would give me Largest Army (2 VP).

The most effective move is to roll the dice first (option 15). If I get resources that help me buy a development card, I can save my Year of Plenty for later. If I don't get useful resources from the roll, I can then use the Year of Plenty on my next action.

Playing the Year of Plenty now would be premature, as I might gain the resources I need from the roll, making the card use suboptimal.

<plan>
1. Roll dice to see what resources I receive
2. If roll doesn't provide needed resources for development card, use Year of Plenty to get ORE+SHEEP
3. Buy development card hoping for knight to secure Largest Army (2 VP)
4. Continue developing toward wheat port at node 34
5. Save resources for city upgrades (focus on ore and wheat)
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis: Settlers of Catan Turn 29

Let me analyze the current game state and available options carefully to determine the optimal move.

## Current Game Assessment
- I have 3 VP from 3 settlements
- RED has 5 VP (3 settlements + 2 VP for longest road)
- I have 2 played knights, so I'm close to getting largest army (need 3+ knights)
- Current resources: 1 BRICK, 1 SHEEP, 3 WHEAT, 1 ORE
- I have a Year of Plenty development card
- The robber is on BRICK (8) - but this seems to be the one resource I don't urgently need

## Options Analysis

1. **Buy a Development Card**: 
   - Costs 1 SHEEP + 1 WHEAT + 1 ORE
   - I have exactly these resources
   - Benefits: Could get Victory Point card, Knight (for largest army), or useful action card
   - This aligns with my development card strategy path to victory

2. **Play Year of Plenty**:
   - Could get various resource combinations
   - Best combinations would enable purchasing multiple development cards or building settlements/roads
   - The ORE+ORE option would give me enough to build a city (with my existing ORE)

## Strategic Evaluation

Looking at my VP situation (3/10), I need to accelerate my path to victory. My current plan mentions securing Largest Army, which gives 2 VP. I already have 2 knights played, so I'm only 1 knight away.

The most immediate path to victory would include:
- Getting Largest Army (2 VP bonus) = +2 VP
- My current 3 settlements (3 VP) = +3 VP
- Upgrading settlements to cities (2 VP each) = potential +6 VP
- Possible hidden VP cards from development cards

Let me calculate the fastest route:

If I buy a development card now, I have a chance of getting:
- Knight (helps toward largest army)
- Victory Point card (direct VP)
- Action card (more resources/tactical advantages)

If I use Year of Plenty instead:
- ORE+ORE would give me 3 ORE total, enough for upgrading a settlement to a city (need 3 ORE + 2 WHEAT)
  BUT I only have 3 WHEAT, not enough for a city yet
- Other combinations don't give me immediate advantage for city building

<plan>
1. Buy development card hoping for knight to secure Largest Army (2 VP)
2. If not a knight, hope for Victory Point or useful action card
3. Continue saving resources for city upgrades (need more ore)
4. Develop toward wheat port at node 34 with future roads/settlements
5. Maintain development card strategy as primary path to victory
</plan>

The optimal move right now is to buy a development card. It aligns with my primary path to victory through development cards, and gives me the best chance at securing largest army (2 VP bonus). It also keeps my resources low to avoid losing to a 7 roll.

# Game Analysis for Blue Player

I'll analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action to take.

## Current Game State
- We have 3 victory points (3 settlements)
- We have 1 BRICK, 2 WHEAT resources
- We have 2 YEAR_OF_PLENTY development cards
- We've played 2 KNIGHT cards (need 1 more for Largest Army bonus)
- Red has 5 victory points (3 settlements + Longest Road bonus)
- The robber is on the brick hex at (0,0,0), blocking one of our resource-producing hexes

## Resource Assessment
Currently, we don't have enough resources for:
- Building a settlement (need BRICK, WOOD, WHEAT, SHEEP)
- Upgrading to a city (need 3 ORE, 2 WHEAT)
- Buying a development card (need ORE, WHEAT, SHEEP)

## Available Options
I need to decide whether to play a Year of Plenty card and if so, which resources to take.

## Strategic Decision Making

Looking at our current plan and situation:
1. Our primary goal is to secure Largest Army (2 VP) by buying development cards
2. We also want to upgrade settlements to cities
3. We need to save resources for these goals

For Largest Army, we need to buy at least one more development card (hoping for a Knight).
- To buy a development card: 1 ORE + 1 WHEAT + 1 SHEEP

For upgrading a settlement to a city:
- Resources needed: 3 ORE + 2 WHEAT (we already have 2 WHEAT)

Using a Year of Plenty card now could help us gather resources for either of these strategies:

If we choose option [0] - Take ORE + ORE:
- This gives us 2 ORE, which is a good step toward a city upgrade
- We would still need 1 more ORE and we already have 2 WHEAT for a city

If we choose option [12] - Take WHEAT + ORE:
- This gives us 1 ORE and 1 WHEAT
- Combined with our existing 2 WHEAT, we'd have 3 WHEAT and 1 ORE
- This could be useful for either development card or contributing to a city

If we choose option [4] - Take SHEEP + ORE:
- This gives us 1 SHEEP and 1 ORE
- Combined with our existing 2 WHEAT, we'd have everything needed for a development card
- This aligns with our primary strategy of pursuing Largest Army

## Decision

Option [4] (SHEEP + ORE) is optimal because:
1. It allows us to immediately buy a development card on our next turn
2. Development cards align with our victory strategy (seeking knights for Largest Army)
3. Even if we don't get a knight, we might get a Victory Point card or another useful action card

<plan>
1. Use Year of Plenty to get SHEEP and ORE
2. Next turn, buy a development card (hoping for knight)
3. Continue pursuing Largest Army (2 VP)
4. Save resources for city upgrades (particularly targeting ORE)
5. Maintain development card strategy as primary path to victory
</plan>

\boxed{4}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis for Catan Turn 29

I'll analyze the current game state to determine my best action.

## Current Situation
- I have 3 VP (3 settlements)
- RED has 5 VP (3 settlements + 2 VP for longest road)
- I have 1 BRICK, 1 SHEEP, 2 WHEAT, 1 ORE
- I hold 1 YEAR_OF_PLENTY development card
- I've played 2 KNIGHT cards previously

## Resource Assessment
With my current resources (1 BRICK, 1 SHEEP, 2 WHEAT, 1 ORE), I can:
- Buy 1 development card (costs 1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE)
- I cannot build any settlements, cities, or roads with my current resources

## Strategic Considerations
1. **Development Card Path**: I've already played 2 knights. If I buy more development cards and get knights, I'm on track for largest army (2 VP)
2. **Victory Point Cards**: Development cards might contain hidden victory points
3. **Resource Efficiency**: Using my exact resources now prevents potential loss from a "7" roll
4. **Opponent Assessment**: RED is at 5 VP with longest road, presenting a 2-point lead

## My Decision
Given that:
- I can't build any infrastructure with my current resources
- I already have 2 knights played, so I'm 1 knight away from largest army (2 VP)
- Development cards might contain victory points or utility cards
- My current plan already indicates a development card focus

Buying a development card is my optimal move. It maintains my pursuit of largest army and potentially gives me victory points or utility cards.

<plan>
1. Buy development card now
2. Use Year of Plenty next turn to get resources needed based on what I draw
3. Continue pursuing Largest Army (1 more knight needed)
4. Build toward city upgrades when resources allow
5. Maintain development card strategy as primary path to victory

# Game Analysis for Turn 31

Let me analyze the current game state and my options carefully:

## Current Game Situation:
- I have 3 VP from 3 settlements
- Red has 5 VP (3 from settlements + 2 from longest road)
- I have 2 knights played so far (one more for largest army)
- Resources on hand: 1 BRICK, 1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT
- Development cards: 1 KNIGHT, 1 YEAR_OF_PLENTY

## Available Actions:
1. Play Year of Plenty card (various resource combinations)
2. Play Knight card and move the robber
3. Roll the dice

## Strategic Considerations:

The robber is currently on the brick hex (0,0,0) with number 8. This is a high-probability hex that I'm connected to with my settlement at node 1. Removing the robber would be beneficial.

My current plan focuses on development cards and pursuing largest army. I currently need one more knight to get largest army (2 VP).

If I play my knight now:
- I can move the robber from my brick production
- I can potentially steal a resource from Red
- I'd secure largest army (2 VP bonus), bringing me to 5 VP

If I roll:
- I might get more resources to work with
- But the robber stays on my brick production hex
- I risk a 7 being rolled (though with only 3 cards I'm safe from discarding)

If I play Year of Plenty:
- I'd gain two resources of my choice
- But this doesn't advance my largest army goal

## Decision Logic:

Playing the knight card is the strongest move because:
1. It immediately increases my VP total to 5 (tying with Red)
2. It removes the robber from my brick production
3. I can place the robber on one of Red's productive hexes
4. I might steal a useful resource from Red

This aligns with my development card strategy and puts me in a strong position to continue pursuing cities or more development cards in subsequent turns.

<plan>
1. Play knight card now to secure largest army (2 VP)
2. Move robber to Red's wheat/brick hex with 8 value
3. Use Year of Plenty next turn based on what resources I need
4. Focus on city upgrades (ore/wheat) with my next builds
5. Continue development card strategy alongside city building
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

❓ Select action by number (0-17):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze this robber placement situation carefully to choose the optimal move.

First, let me understand the current state of the game:
- I'm BLUE with 5 victory points (3 settlements + largest army)
- RED also has 5 victory points (3 settlements + longest road)
- I just played a knight card which triggered this robber move
- I currently have only 3 resources (1 brick, 1 sheep, 1 wheat)
- I hold a Year of Plenty development card for future use

Let me identify RED's most valuable production:
- Node 4: produces 🧱8[⭐⭐⭐], 🌾8[⭐⭐⭐], ⛏️9[⭐⭐] - this is RED's most productive settlement
- Node 8: produces 🐑6[⭐⭐⭐], 🐑4[⭐], 🌲5[⭐⭐] - good sheep production
- Node 17: produces ⛏️9[⭐⭐], 🐑3[⭐], 🌾11[⭐] - less productive

Looking at the available robber moves that affect RED's production:
- [0] Move to (1, -1, 0): This blocks RED's 6-sheep hex that produces for node 8
- [2] Move to (-1, 0, 1): This blocks RED's 8-wheat hex that produces for node 4 (high value)
- [3] Move to (-1, 1, 0): This blocks RED's 9-ore hex that produces for nodes 4 and 17
- [6] Move to (2, -2, 0): This blocks RED's 4-sheep hex that produces for node 8 (low value)
- [7] Move to (1, -2, 1): This blocks RED's 5-wood hex that produces for node 8
- [11] Move to (-2, 1, 1): This blocks RED's 3-sheep hex for node 17 (low value)
- [12] Move to (-2, 2, 0): This blocks RED's 11-wheat hex for node 17 (low probability)

The most strategic options are:
1. Option [2] to block the 8-wheat hex: This is a high-probability hex (8) producing a crucial resource for RED's settlement at node 4
2. Option [3] to block the 9-ore hex: This affects both RED settlements (nodes 4 and 17)

Between these two, option [2] is more impactful because:
- The 8-wheat hex is a higher probability than the 9-ore hex
- Wheat is crucial for both settlements and development cards
- RED likely has some resources accumulated (6 cards), and stealing might give me a wheat for my own development

<plan>
1. Move robber to RED's wheat hex with 8 value and steal a resource
2. Use Year of Plenty next turn based on what resources I need
3. Focus on city upgrades (ore/wheat) with my next builds
4. Continue development card strategy alongside city building
5. Block RED's high-value production to slow their progress
</plan>

Therefore, my optimal move is to choose option 2 - Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED.

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze the current game state and available options to make the optimal decision.

## Current Game Status
- I'm BLUE with 5/10 victory points (3 from settlements, 2 from largest army)
- RED has 6/10 victory points (4 from settlements, 2 from longest road)
- I have resources: 1 WOOD, 1 BRICK, 2 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT
- I have 1 YEAR_OF_PLENTY development card available

## Strategic Analysis

First, let me assess my position relative to RED:
- RED is ahead by 1 VP (6/10 vs my 5/10)
- RED likely has strong expansion plans with their current settlements
- I need to execute my development card strategy effectively to win

My key priorities should be:
1. Building cities (requires 3 ORE + 2 WHEAT each)
2. Potentially buying development cards (1 ORE + 1 WHEAT + 1 SHEEP)
3. Building strategic settlements (1 WOOD + 1 BRICK + 1 WHEAT + 1 SHEEP)

Looking at my resources (1 WOOD, 1 BRICK, 2 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT), I don't have enough for any major build yet. I need to think about which resources to acquire through Year of Plenty.

## Year of Plenty Options Analysis

For upgrading to a city, I need 3 ORE and 2 WHEAT. I currently have 1 WHEAT, so I need:
- 3 ORE and 1 more WHEAT

For buying a development card, I need 1 ORE, 1 WHEAT, and 1 SHEEP. I already have 1 WHEAT and 2 SHEEP, so I need:
- 1 ORE

Given that cities provide the best VP-to-resource ratio (2 VP for 5 resources = 0.4 VP per resource), my priority should be getting the resources for a city upgrade.

The best options are:
- [0] Take two ORE (building toward city)
- [12] Take WHEAT and ORE (building toward city)

Option [0] gives me 2 ORE, which combined with my current resources gives me 1 WOOD, 1 BRICK, 2 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, and 2 ORE. I would still be 1 ORE and 1 WHEAT short of a city upgrade.

Option [12] gives me 1 WHEAT and 1 ORE, which combined with my current resources gives me 1 WOOD, 1 BRICK, 2 SHEEP, 2 WHEAT, and 1 ORE. I would still be 2 ORE short of a city upgrade.

## Decision Logic

Looking at my production capabilities:
- I have a settlement on node 12 producing WHEAT (8) and ORE (12)
- I have a settlement on node 1 producing BRICK (8) and SHEEP (6)
- I have a settlement on node 14 producing WHEAT (8) and SHEEP (3)

Wheat on 8 is a strong producer, but ORE on 12 is less reliable. I need ORE more urgently than additional WHEAT. Taking 2 ORE now gets me closer to building a city faster.

<plan>
1. Use Year of Plenty to get 2 ORE
2. Use future production to acquire the remaining 1 ORE and 1 WHEAT needed for a city upgrade
3. Upgrade one of my settlements to a city (particularly one on a high-producing hex)
4. Continue to buy development cards when possible to maintain largest army and potentially get VP cards
5. Consider blocking RED's expansion by strategic road building if resources allow
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I choose option [0] - Play Year of Plenty card to take two ORE resources.

\boxed{0}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 33 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Use Year of Plenty to get 2 ORE
2. Use future production to acquire the remaining 1 ORE and 1 WHEAT needed for a city upgrade
3. Upgrade one of my settlements to a city (particularly one on a high-producing hex)
4. Continue to buy development cards when possible to maintain largest army and potentially get VP cards
5. Consider blocking RED's expansion by strategic road building if resources allow
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze my current position and best move options:

## Current Game State
- I have 5 VP (3 settlements + largest army)
- Red has 6 VP (4 settlements + longest road)
- Resources: 2 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK, 2 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 2 ⛏️ORE
- No development cards in hand
- Robber is on wheat hex at (-1,0,1), which is one of my productive wheat hexes

## Options Analysis

**Option 0: End Turn**
- Not optimal as I have enough resources to take actions that improve my position

**Options 1-10: Build Road**
- Would use my wood and brick
- Could potentially work toward longest road or new settlement locations
- Road at edge (34, 35) leads toward wheat port, which could be strategic
- However, road building alone doesn't immediately increase VP

**Option 11: Build Settlement at Node 34**
- Costs: 1 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 🐑SHEEP
- Would provide +1 VP immediately (to 6 VP)
- Would connect to 🌾 wheat hex (10) and 🌲 wood hex (2)
- Adjacent to wheat port
- This is a strong immediate VP gain

**Option 12: Buy Development Card**
- Costs: 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE
- Could be a Victory Point card (25% chance)
- Could be a Knight (40% chance) to strengthen largest army
- Could be a helpful action card
- Aligns with development card strategy

## Strategic Decision Making

I need to prioritize paths to victory. I'm currently at 5 VP, while Red is at 6 VP.

If I build the settlement at node 34:
- I gain 1 VP immediately, tying with Red at 6 VP
- I gain access to potential wheat production and the wheat port
- I deplete most of my resources

If I buy a development card:
- I maintain resource flexibility
- Possibility of hidden VP or another knight
- Preserves my brick and wood for future road/settlement
- Follows my primary strategy of development card dominance

Looking at my resources and the opportunity for a settlement, I need to adjust my plan:

<plan>
1. Build settlement at node 34 to gain 1 VP and tie with Red
2. This settlement gives me access to the wheat port and more production
3. Continue buying development cards when possible to maintain largest army
4. Target upgrades to cities using future ore and wheat production
5. Focus expansion toward valuable resource nodes
</plan>

The settlement provides immediate VP value and positions me well for future turns. Since I'm in a race for 10 VP and Red is ahead, gaining a VP now is more valuable than the potential future advantage of a development card.

Therefore, my optimal action is:

\boxed{11}

- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 35 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Build settlement at node 34 to gain 1 VP and tie with Red
2. This settlement gives me access to the wheat port and more production
3. Continue buying development cards when possible to maintain largest army
4. Target upgrades to cities using future ore and wheat production
5. Focus expansion toward valuable resource nodes

# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to choose where to place the robber to maximize my strategic position against RED, who appears to be my main opponent.

## Game State Analysis
- Both RED and I have 6 victory points
- RED has longest road (2 VP) and 4 settlements (4 VP)
- I have largest army (2 VP) and 4 settlements (4 VP)
- I only have 1 wood and 2 ore cards
- RED has 4 hidden cards
- I need to disrupt RED's production while potentially gaining a useful resource

## Key Resource Considerations
1. Looking at RED's settlements:
   - Node 4: Produces brick(8), wheat(8), ore(9) - high value production
   - Node 8: Produces sheep(6), sheep(4), wood(5) - good sheep production
   - Node 17: Produces ore(9), sheep(3), wheat(11) - ore and wheat
   - Node 16: Produces ore(9), brick(3), sheep(10) - ore and brick

2. Most valuable RED hexes to block:
   - Brick 8 (★★★) - high probability brick production
   - Wheat 8 (★★★) - high probability wheat production
   - Ore 9 (★★) - moderate-high ore production that appears at TWO of RED's settlements

## Robber Options Analysis
The most strategic options are:
- Option [0]: Block brick 8 hex (0,0,0) - This blocks RED's high-value brick
- Option [3]: Block wheat 8 hex (-1,0,1) - This blocks RED's high-value wheat
- Option [4]: Block ore 9 hex (-1,1,0) - This blocks TWO of RED's settlements (16 and 17)

Option [4] is most impactful as it denies ore production from two of RED's settlements with one robber placement. Ore is crucial for city upgrades and development cards, which RED likely needs to reach 10 VP.

Additionally, stealing from RED could give me a needed resource for my next build.

<plan>
1. Disrupt RED's ore production with robber on hex (-1,1,0)
2. Continue saving resources to upgrade settlements to cities
3. Maintain largest army advantage
4. Consider a road building strategy to challenge longest road
5. Continue development card strategy when I have resources
</plan>

Based on this analysis, placing the robber on the ore 9 hex (-1,1,0) provides the most strategic advantage by blocking production for two of RED's settlements.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

❓ Select action by number (0-17):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I need to analyze the board state and determine the optimal robber placement to maximize my chances of winning.

First, let's understand the current standings and strategic position:
- I (BLUE) have 6 victory points from 4 settlements and largest army bonus
- RED also has 6 victory points from 4 settlements and longest road bonus
- I have resources: 3 wood, 1 wheat, 2 ore
- The robber is currently on (-1, 1, 0) which is an ore hex with dice number 9

Looking at my current plan, I want to disrupt RED's production while protecting my high-production hexes. Let me analyze RED's settlements:
- RED has settlements at nodes 4, 8, 16, and 17
- Node 4 produces brick(8), wheat(8), and ore(9) - very valuable resources with high probability
- Node 8 produces sheep(6), sheep(4), and wood(5) - good sheep production
- Node 16 produces ore(9), brick(3), and sheep(10) - ore is valuable
- Node 17 produces ore(9), sheep(3), and wheat(11) - ore is valuable

Especially important to note that RED has access to both ore and wheat with high probability numbers (8 and 9), which are crucial for building cities and development cards.

My best options are:

1. Option [0]: Move robber to (0, 0, 0) - This is a brick hex with an 8 (high probability). It blocks RED's node 4 settlement, which produces both brick(8) and wheat(8). This would significantly disrupt RED's ability to build roads and settlements.

2. Option [3]: Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) - This is a wheat hex with an 8 (high probability). It blocks RED's node 4 settlement again, disrupting wheat production which is crucial for cities and development cards.

3. Option [1]: Move robber to (1, -1, 0) - This is a sheep hex with a 6 (good probability). It blocks RED's node 8 settlement.

4. Option [11]: Move robber to (-2, 1, 1) - This is a sheep hex with only a 3 (low probability). Not a strong choice.

Weighing these options:
- Option [0] blocks a key brick production for RED, who already has longest road. This would make it harder for them to extend their road advantage.
- Option [3] blocks wheat which is critical for cities and development cards.

Since RED already has longest road (and needs brick to maintain that advantage), and both options block a highly productive settlement, I believe option [0] is slightly better than [3]. By placing the robber on the brick hex, I can slow RED's road-building strategy while also getting to steal a card from them.

<plan>
1. Disrupt RED's brick production with robber to limit their road-building capability
2. Continue saving resources to upgrade settlements to cities (focus on getting more ore and wheat)
3. Maintain largest army advantage by buying development cards when possible
4. Build roads strategically to potentially challenge RED for longest road
5. Work toward upgrading settlements to cities for more efficient resource production

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and available options:

## Current Position
- I (BLUE) have 6 victory points (4 settlements + 2 points for largest army)
- RED also has 6 victory points (4 settlements + 2 points for longest road)
- I have: 3 🌲WOOD, 1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 2 ⛏️ORE
- The robber is on the brick hex (0,0,0), which is one of my BLUE settlement's resources at node 1

## Available Actions
1. Buy a development card (1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE)
2. End my turn

## Strategic Considerations

Looking at my development card strategy, buying development cards is a primary path to victory, especially since:
- I already have largest army with 3 knights
- A victory point card would put me at 7 VP
- Any additional knight would strengthen my largest army lead
- Other development cards like Monopoly or Year of Plenty could provide tactical advantages

However, buying another development card would use most of my resources, leaving me with just 3 wood and 1 ore, which isn't enough to build anything significant next turn.

My current plan includes upgrading settlements to cities, which requires ore and wheat. I only have 2 ore right now and 1 wheat, so I'm still short of the 3 ore + 2 wheat needed for a city upgrade.

Looking at the long-term strategy, development cards offer the most efficient path to victory since:
- I already have largest army
- Development cards might contain victory points
- Hidden victory points give me a surprise win advantage

<plan>
1. Buy development cards to potentially secure victory points or additional knights
2. Continue gathering resources (especially ore and wheat) for city upgrades
3. Maintain largest army advantage
4. Look for opportunities to disrupt RED with the robber on key production hexes
5. Consider expanding roads only if it provides strategic advantage or blocks RED
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I will purchase a development card as it aligns with my primary path to victory and offers the best chance of gaining victory points or useful tactical cards.

# Game Analysis

Let me think through the current game state and my options:

## Victory Point Status:
- I (BLUE) have 6 VP: 4 settlements (4 VP) + Largest Army (2 VP)
- RED has 6 VP: 4 settlements (4 VP) + Longest Road (2 VP)
- We're tied, but I need 4 more VP to win

## Resource Analysis:
- I have: 3 🌲WOOD, 2 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE
- The robber is currently on the brick hex (0,0,0), blocking that production
- RED has only 1 hidden resource card

## Options:
1. Play Knight card - This would let me move the robber and steal a resource from RED
2. Roll the dice - Standard play to collect resources based on the roll

## Decision Factors:
- If I roll, I could get resources needed for development cards or building
- If I play the Knight card:
  - I can move the robber from the brick hex to a better target (RED's productive hexes)
  - I can steal one of RED's resources (they only have 1)
  - This protects my knight advantage (already have 3 played)
  - I want to keep disrupting RED's resource production

## Strategic Consideration:
The robber is currently on a brick hex that does produce for RED but not for me. Moving it could be beneficial to target one of RED's more productive hexes like the wheat 8 or brick 8 hex.

Playing the knight now would be a defensive move rather than saving it for when the robber blocks one of my productive hexes. However, since RED only has 1 card, it's not a high-value steal opportunity.

<plan>
1. Roll dice to collect resources first
2. Use development card strategy - buy more development cards when possible
3. Save my knight card for when the robber is placed on one of my productive hexes
4. Continue to maintain largest army advantage
5. Look for opportunities to upgrade to cities when I collect enough ore and wheat
</plan>

Given these considerations, the optimal move is to roll the dice to collect more resources first, saving the knight card for a more strategic moment.

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 43 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Roll dice to collect resources first
2. Use development card strategy - buy more development cards when possible
3. Save my knight card for when the robber is placed on one of my productive hexes
4. Continue to maintain largest army advantage
5. Look for opportunities to upgrade to cities when I collect enough ore and wheat
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis

I'll analyze the current game state and my options for this turn:

## Victory Point Status:
- My VPs: 6/10 (4 settlements + largest army)
- Red's VPs: 6/10 (4 settlements + longest road)

## Current Resources:
I have 3 Wood, 2 Wheat, and 1 Ore. Not enough for any major builds (city requires 3 ore + 2 wheat, settlement requires wood + brick + wheat + sheep).

## Development Cards:
- I have 1 unused Knight card
- I've already played 3 Knights (maintaining largest army)

## Robber Location:
Currently on (0, 0, 0), which is a brick hex with value 8. This is actually hurting Red more than me since Red has a settlement there that produces brick.

## Options:

1. Play Knight card:
   - This would let me move the robber to a different hex
   - I could target Red's most productive settlement (node 4, producing wheat 8 and brick 8)
   - I could steal a card from Red (who has 4)
   - But the robber is already on a brick 8 hex that's hurting Red more than me

2. End turn:
   - The robber is already on a hex that's more advantageous to me than Red
   - I'd save my Knight for when the robber is placed on one of my productive hexes
   - I don't have enough resources for any significant builds anyway

## Strategic Considerations:
- The robber is currently in an optimal position for me - blocking Red's brick production
- My Knight card provides more value as insurance against future robber placements
- Red's 4 hidden resources could be used against me next turn
- But playing Knight now would let me steal a card and potentially disrupt Red's plans

<plan>
1. Save my Knight card for when the robber is placed on one of my productive hexes
2. Continue to maintain largest army advantage
3. Wait for more resources to upgrade settlements to cities (priority) or build more settlements
4. Look for opportunities to break up Red's longest road in the future
</plan>

After careful consideration, I'll end my turn. The robber is already in a good position for me, and saving the Knight card for when it's truly needed is more valuable.

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current state and my options carefully to make the optimal decision:

## Current Situation Assessment
- **Victory Points**: I have 6/10 VP (4 settlements + largest army bonus)
- **Resources**: 3 🌲WOOD, 2 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE
- **Development Cards**: 1 KNIGHT card available to play
- **Robber**: Currently on the 🧱8 (0, 0, 0) brick hex

## Option Analysis
My options are:
1. **Play Knight** - Move the robber and steal a resource
2. **Roll the dice** - Standard turn progression

### Option 0: Play Knight
**Pros:**
- Protect my highest-producing hexes if the dice roll is a 7
- Move the robber from the 🧱8 hex (currently blocking a valuable hex)
- Steal a resource from an opponent
- Strengthen my largest army advantage

**Cons:**
- I'm already holding the largest army with 3 knights
- The robber isn't currently on any of my high-production hexes
- My resources aren't ideal for building anything significant right now, so I'd be revealing my knight without immediate follow-up
- I could save the knight for when I'm actually threatened by the robber

### Option 1: Roll the Dice
**Pros:**
- Progress my turn normally without using up strategic assets
- Could gain more resources to potentially build something
- Save knight for when robber is placed on one of my productive hexes
- Current robber position doesn't severely hurt my production

**Cons:**
- Risk rolling a 7 with 6 cards (but I currently only have 6 cards, so I'm safe)

## Strategic Decision
The robber isn't currently affecting any of my productive hexes, so playing the knight card now would be suboptimal. I should follow my plan of saving the knight for when the robber directly threatens my production.

The best course of action is to roll the dice and continue resource accumulation. I'll stick to my existing plan of focusing on upgrading settlements to cities when I have enough resources.

<plan>
1. Save my Knight card for when the robber is placed on one of my productive hexes
2. Continue to maintain largest army advantage
3. Focus on gathering ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
4. Look for opportunities to break up Red's longest road in the future

- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Save my Knight card for when the robber is placed on one of my productive hexes
2. Continue to maintain largest army advantage
3. Focus on gathering ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
4. Look for opportunities to break up Red's longest road in the future

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze my current position in the game:

- I have 6 victory points (4 from settlements and 2 from largest army)
- My resources: 3 🌲WOOD, 4 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE
- I have 1 KNIGHT card I could play, which would strengthen my largest army
- The robber is on the 🧱8 (0, 0, 0) hex, which is blocking my settlement at node 1

## Resource Assessment
- I need more ORE to upgrade settlements to cities
- I have decent WHEAT production but lacking sufficient ORE
- I can't build anything useful with my current resources
- I can't purchase development cards (need 1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE)

## Opponent Assessment
- RED has 6 VP (4 from settlements, 2 from longest road)
- RED has 5 hidden resource cards
- RED controls valuable 8-value hexes for 🧱BRICK and 🌾WHEAT

## Available Actions Evaluation:

**Option 0: Play Knight card**
- Pros: Move the robber from my productive hex at node 1, potentially steal a resource from RED
- Cons: I should ideally save my Knight card for when I really need it

**Option 1: End turn**
- Pros: Simple, no need to use Knight card yet
- Cons: The robber remains on my 🧱8 hex, continuing to block my production

**Options 2-5: Maritime Trade**
- I don't need to trade WHEAT for other resources at poor 4:1 ratios
- I can't build anything significant with any trade outcome
- These would be inefficient uses of my resources

## Decision Process

The robber is currently on the 🧱8 hex which affects my settlement at node 1. This is a high-value hex (8) which would normally produce brick at my settlement. Moving the robber would unlock this production for future turns.

Additionally, playing the Knight would strengthen my largest army advantage, making it harder for RED to overtake me in that category.

Finally, by playing the Knight, I can potentially steal a resource from RED who has 5 cards, which could help my position.

<plan>
1. Play Knight card to move robber from my productive brick hex
2. Place robber on RED's high-value hex (likely the 🌾8 or 🧱8 hex that RED controls)
3. Steal a card from RED, hoping for ore or brick
4. Focus on gathering resources to upgrade settlements to cities
5. Maintain largest army advantage

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESPONSE:
## Game Analysis

I need to move the robber from my 🧱8 hex and place it optimally. Let me analyze the best placement:

### Red's Production Areas:
- Node 4: 🧱8 (⭐⭐⭐), 🌾8 (⭐⭐⭐), ⛏️9 (⭐⭐) - Very high value
- Node 8: 🐑6 (⭐⭐⭐), 🐑4 (⭐), 🌲5 (⭐⭐) - Good sheep production
- Nodes 16-17: ⛏️9, 🧱3, 🐑3, 🌾11, 🐑10 - Lower value

### Strategic Considerations:
1. Red is at 6 VPs (including 2 for longest road) and has 5 cards
2. I need to target their best production to slow them down
3. The most valuable hex for Red is (-1, 0, 1) which is the 🌾8 hex - this provides high wheat production
4. This hex is connected to Red's settlement at node 4 (which produces from three strong hexes)
5. Moving the robber to this hex would disrupt Red's best settlement

### Resource Analysis:
- I currently have 3 🌲, 4 🌾, 1 ⛏️
- I need more 🧱 and ⛏️ to build settlements or upgrade to cities
- Stealing from Red could potentially get me those resources

### Best Robber Placement:
Option [2] - Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED
- This targets the 🌾8 hex which is Red's high-value wheat hex
- This blocks significant wheat production for Red
- I can also steal a card from Red, possibly getting brick or ore that I need
- This aligns with my current plan to disrupt Red while working toward city upgrades

<plan>
1. Move robber to Red's 🌾8 hex and steal a card, hoping for ore or brick
2. Continue collecting resources for city upgrades (prioritize ore and wheat)
3. Maintain largest army advantage with future knight cards if available
4. Focus on upgrading at least one settlement to a city
5. Consider expanding with roads toward the brick port (nodes 52, 53) for better trade options
</plan>

- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 45 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Move robber to Red's 🌾8 hex and steal a card, hoping for ore or brick
2. Continue collecting resources for city upgrades (prioritize ore and wheat)
3. Maintain largest army advantage with future knight cards if available
4. Focus on upgrading at least one settlement to a city
5. Consider expanding with roads toward the brick port (nodes 52, 53) for better trade options

# Game Analysis and Decision

Let me thoroughly analyze the game state and available actions to determine the optimal move:

## Current Game State
- I have 6/10 victory points (4 settlements + largest army)
- Red also has 6/10 victory points (4 settlements + longest road)
- Resources: 3 Wood, 1 Sheep, 4 Wheat, 1 Ore
- Robber is on a wheat hex (-1, 0, 1) - one of my productive hexes

## Available Actions
0. End turn
1. Buy development card (costs 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore)
2-5. Trade wheat for other resources via port (4:1 ratio)

## Strategic Analysis

Development Card Evaluation:
- 19 development cards remain in the deck
- Composition of remaining cards is unknown, but likely includes:
  - Victory point cards (immediate hidden VP)
  - Knights (can secure largest army)
  - Year of Plenty/Monopoly (utility)
- Getting a victory point card would put me at 7 VP
- Getting another knight would strengthen my largest army position
- Any card would be hidden information, giving me strategic advantage

Resource Assessment:
- I need ore and wheat for city upgrades (already have 1 ore, 4 wheat)
- I need brick and wood for road/settlement expansion (have 3 wood, need brick)
- Trading 4 wheat for 1 brick (option 5) would allow future expansion
- Current resources don't allow for any immediate builds

Path to Victory Options:
1. Development Card Path:
   - Buy more development cards hoping for VP cards/knights
   - Need 4 more VP (could come from 2 cities + hidden VP cards)
2. Build Path:
   - Upgrade settlements to cities (2 VP each)
   - Need more ore for city upgrades
   - Could expand toward brick port for better trading

Opponent Assessment:
- Red has 6 VP and longest road
- Red could potentially have development cards with hidden VP
- Red may be close to winning

Decision Logic:
- Buying a development card has the highest ceiling for immediate value
- Trading wheat for brick doesn't enable an immediate build
- Development card provides hidden information advantage
- Any knight or VP card improves my position significantly

<plan>
1. Buy development card (hoping for knight or victory point)
2. Continue collecting resources for city upgrades (need more ore)
3. Maintain largest army advantage
4. Look for opportunities to expand toward brick port (nodes 52, 53)
5. Focus on reaching 10 VP through a combination of cities and hidden victory points
</plan>

The optimal move is to buy a development card which could potentially give me a hidden victory point or knight to secure largest army.

# Game Analysis: Turn 47 - Blue Player

I'll analyze my options carefully to determine the optimal move.

## Current Situation Summary:
- I have 6 VP (4 settlements + largest army)
- Resources: 3 wood, 2 wheat
- Development Cards: 1 knight card remaining
- Robber is on hex (1, 0, -1) which is a wood hex with value 4
- Red has 6 VP (4 settlements + longest road)
- The game is tied at 6-6

## Option Analysis:

### Option 0: Play Knight Card
- Benefits:
  - Moves robber from a hex (wood 4) that potentially produces resources for me
  - Can reposition robber to block Red's best production
  - Guarantees keeping largest army advantage (5 knights vs unknown)
  - Can steal a resource from Red (who has 5 cards)
- Drawbacks:
  - Would use my knight card that could be saved for when the robber blocks my critical resources
  - Red has 5 hidden cards, so stealing is unpredictable
  - Generally better to roll first and see what resources I get before playing development cards

### Option 1: Roll Dice
- Benefits:
  - Potentially gain more resources before making tactical decisions
  - Can still play knight afterward if desired
  - Preserves strategic flexibility
  - May get resources needed for city upgrade or development card
- Drawbacks:
  - Risk of rolling a 7 and losing cards if I gain too many resources
  - Risk that Red plays knight on their turn before I can use mine

## Decision Logic:
The knight card provides more value if used reactively rather than proactively. Currently, the robber isn't significantly hurting my production, and I don't have enough resources to build anything major even if I steal a card from Red.

Rolling first gives me more information and resources before making a tactical decision. After rolling, I can still play the knight if needed, especially if I roll a good number and gain enough resources for a meaningful build.

<plan>
1. Roll for resources first
2. If roll is successful (getting ore/wheat), consider city upgrade or development card
3. Save knight card for defensive purposes or when I have enough resources to make a key build
4. Continue focus on city upgrades and development cards for victory points
5. Look for opportunities to expand toward brick port (nodes 52, 53) if resources permit
</plan>

The optimal strategy is to maximize my information and resource position before committing to using the knight card.

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 47 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Roll for resources first
2. If roll is successful (getting ore/wheat), consider city upgrade or development card
3. Save knight card for defensive purposes or when I have enough resources to make a key build
4. Continue focus on city upgrades and development cards for victory points
5. Look for opportunities to expand toward brick port (nodes 52, 53) if resources permit
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis for Blue Player (Turn 47)

Let me analyze my current position and available actions:

## Current Game Status
- I have 6/10 victory points (4 settlements + Largest Army)
- Resources: 3 Wood, 1 Brick, 4 Wheat
- Development Cards: 1 Knight card
- Red has 6 points as well (4 settlements + Longest Road)

## Resource Analysis
- I can build a road with my current resources (3 Wood, 1 Brick)
- I have 4 Wheat but insufficient other resources for settlements, cities, or development cards
- The robber is on a Wood hex (1,0,-1) which is blocking one of my production spots
- I can't afford maritime trades with my current resources

## Strategic Options

1. **Play Knight card (Action 0)**: 
   - This would move the robber from my wood hex
   - Could steal a resource from Red (who has 7 cards)
   - Strengthens my Largest Army lead (would be 5 knights)
   - Frees up potential wood production

2. **Build a Road (Actions 2-11)**:
   - Would use my Wood and Brick resources
   - Could strategically position for future settlements
   - Best options would be roads that:
     * Lead toward valuable expansion spots
     * Help block Red's expansion
     * Position me toward ports or high-value intersections

3. **End Turn (Action 1)**:
   - Save resources for future builds
   - But this wastes the opportunity to use current resources

## Decision Analysis

Playing the Knight card (Action 0) is clearly optimal because:
- The robber is on my wood production hex (1,0,-1)
- Moving it will restore my wood production
- I can steal a resource from Red who has many cards
- This increases my knight count to 5, further securing Largest Army
- Red currently has 7 cards, so there's a high chance I'll get something useful
- I need other resources (ore, more brick) for future builds

<plan>
1. Play Knight card to move robber from my wood hex and steal from Red
2. Continue focusing on city upgrades when resources permit
3. Use development cards to maintain my lead in Largest Army
4. Look for opportunities to build settlements at strategic locations
5. If Red approaches 8 points, consider blocking their expansion routes
</plan>

\boxed{0}
========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the optimal move for placing the robber as Blue.

First, let me understand the game state:
- I (Blue) have 6 victory points: 4 settlements (4 VP) + Largest Army (2 VP)
- Red also has 6 victory points: 4 settlements (4 VP) + Longest Road (2 VP)
- I have 3 Wood, 1 Brick, 4 Wheat resources
- Red has 7 hidden cards

Let me examine each robber placement option in terms of:
1. Impact on Red's production
2. Resources I might steal
3. Strategic value

High-priority placements:
- Option [0]: Move to (0, 0, 0) - This blocks Red's brick+wheat hex with number 8 (high production)
- Option [3]: Move to (-1, 0, 1) - This blocks Red's wheat hex with number 8 (high production)
- Option [4]: Move to (-1, 1, 0) - This blocks Red's ore hex with number 9
- Option [1]: Move to (1, -1, 0) - This blocks Red's sheep hex with number 6

Let me prioritize blocking Red's highest production hexes. The brick+wheat hex at (0, 0, 0) produces on an 8, which is one of the most frequent rolls. This hex serves Red's settlement at node 4, which produces three high-value resources. By blocking this hex, I can significantly disrupt Red's production of both brick and wheat.

Additionally, with 7 cards in hand, Red likely has resources I could benefit from stealing. Since I already have 4 wheat and only 1 brick, stealing brick would be particularly valuable for my road-building needs.

<plan>
1. Block Red's highest producing hex (0, 0, 0) - the brick+wheat on 8
2. Continue focusing on city upgrades when I acquire ore
3. Use my wheat surplus toward development cards to maintain Largest Army
4. Look to expand toward ore production
5. Monitor Red's advancement and block when necessary
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I should move the robber to the brick/wheat hex with number 8 that Red's settlement at node 4 produces from. This disrupts Red's key resources while potentially allowing me to steal a valuable resource.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

RESPONSE:
# Game Analysis and Decision Making

Let me analyze the current state of the game and my available options:

## Current Situation
- **Victory Points**: I have 6/10 VP (4 settlements + Largest Army)
- **Resources**: 3 Wood, 1 Brick, 4 Wheat, 1 Ore
- **Opponent**: RED has 6/10 VP as well (4 settlements + Longest Road)
- **Robber**: Currently on (0, 0, 0) which is a Brick 8 hex

## Resource Production Assessment
I'm strong in Wheat production (settlements on 8 and 10) but limited in Ore production (just a 12, which is low probability). I need more Ore to upgrade settlements to cities, which is critical for my victory path.

## Available Actions
1. End turn
2. Build a road (requires 1 Wood + 1 Brick, which I have)
3. Maritime trade (trading 4 Wheat for another resource)

## Strategic Options

1. **End Turn Option**
   - Pros: Save resources for more valuable builds later
   - Cons: Miss opportunity to use my current resources

2. **Road Building Option**
   - Pros: Expands my network, possibly toward valuable settlement spots
   - Cons: Uses my only brick which might be better saved for a settlement

3. **Maritime Trade Option**
   - Pros: Could convert excess Wheat into something more useful
   - Cons: 4:1 trade is inefficient (I don't seem to have access to better port trades)

Looking at my overall position, I need to progress toward more VP. The fastest path would be upgrading settlements to cities (2 ore + 3 wheat each). Since I'm low on Ore, I should either position myself to get more Ore or trade for it.

Let me evaluate road options to see if any lead to strategic locations:
- Roads leading toward Ore-producing hexes would be valuable
- Roads that could secure good settlement locations are also important
- Roads that block RED's expansion might be worth considering

<plan>
1. Focus on acquiring more ore for city upgrades
2. Consider maritime trading for ore when I have excess wheat
3. Look for opportunities to build settlements near ore production
4. Maintain Largest Army advantage
5. Monitor RED's progress and block when necessary
</plan>

Given my resources (3 Wood, 1 Brick, 4 Wheat, 1 Ore) and the available actions, I think the most strategic move is to end my turn and save my resources. I don't see a road placement that gives me an immediate strategic advantage worth spending my only Brick on, and the maritime trades are inefficient. I'll be better off saving resources for a more impactful build on a future turn.

Therefore, my action is:

# Analyzing the Game State

I need to decide where to move the robber to maximize my chances of winning. Let's analyze the current situation:

## Current Game Status:
- Both RED and I have 6 VP
- RED has the Longest Road bonus (+2 VP)
- I have the Largest Army bonus (+2 VP)
- My resources: 2 WOOD, 1 BRICK, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE
- RED has 2 hidden cards
- We both have 4 settlements, no cities

## Strategic Considerations:
1. I need to disrupt RED's resource production to slow down their progress
2. I should target high-probability number hexes that RED is using
3. Stealing a resource from RED could help me with my next build
4. I should protect my own key production hexes

## Analyzing RED's Production:
RED's settlements produce from these high-value hexes:
- Brick 8 (⭐⭐⭐) at node 4
- Wheat 8 (⭐⭐⭐) at node 4
- Sheep 6 (⭐⭐⭐) at node 8
- Ore 9 (⭐⭐) at nodes 4, 17, and 16

These are prime targets, especially the 8s and 6s which have the highest probability of rolling.

## Evaluating Options:
- Option [0]: Target Sheep 6 (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED - This blocks a high probability hex (6) that RED produces from
- Option [2]: Target Wheat 8 (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED - This blocks a very high value hex (8) that RED produces from
- Option [3]: Target Ore 9 (-1, 1, 0) and steal from RED - This blocks an important resource (ore) that RED produces from

Looking at my victory path, I need to build cities which require ore and wheat. RED is producing from high-probability ore and wheat hexes, which could help them build cities before me.

## Decision:
Option [2] seems optimal because:
1. It blocks Wheat 8, which is a critical resource with high probability
2. This hex produces for RED's settlement at node 4
3. By blocking this wheat production, I slow down RED's ability to build cities or buy development cards
4. I may also steal a useful resource from RED

<plan>
1. Block RED's wheat production to slow their city development
2. Continue focus on acquiring ore for my own city upgrades
3. Consider using wood and brick to build roads toward potential settlement locations near ore
4. Maintain Largest Army advantage
5. Watch for opportunities to upgrade settlements to cities once I gather more resources
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis and Decision Making

Let me analyze the current game state and make a strategic decision:

## Victory Point Analysis
- I have 6 VP: 4 settlements (4 VP) + Largest Army (2 VP)
- Red has 6 VP: 4 settlements (4 VP) + Longest Road (2 VP)
- We're tied, with 4 more VP needed to win

## Resource Analysis
I currently have:
- 2 Wood, 1 Brick (can build 1 road)
- 2 Wheat, 1 Ore (building toward development cards/cities)

## Strategic Considerations

1. **Current Position**: I have 4 settlements but no cities. My Largest Army (5 knights) gives me 2 VP.

2. **Resource Production**: The robber is on wheat (8), which is blocking a high-value hex, but this is also blocking one of my key production spots. This is hurting my progress.

3. **Red's Threat Level**: Red has Longest Road with 7 segments. They only need 4 more VP to win - likely through city upgrades or development cards.

4. **Road Building Options**: I can build one road now, but need to choose the most strategic location.

## Road Building Analysis

Looking at my road options:
- Most roads don't lead to immediate settlement locations (I need 3 more resources)
- Edge (14, 37) connects to node 37, which is on a 3:1 port and adjacent to wood (2) and sheep (3) - not high-value but offers port access
- Edge (14, 15) extends toward ore (9) production
- Edge (34, 35) moves toward a wheat port (useful for my strategy)

The most valuable option appears to be extending toward resources I need for development cards (ore/wheat) or toward a port that will help my resource conversion strategy.

## Decision

Edge (34, 35) has the most strategic value as it moves toward the wheat port and potentially good expansion opportunities. Edge (14, 15) is also valuable for potential ore access. Given my current goal of strengthening development card capabilities and city building, I'll extend toward the wheat port.

<plan>
1. Build road toward wheat port to improve wheat resource trading efficiency
2. Continue gathering ore/wheat for city upgrades and development cards
3. Watch for opportunity to break RED's longest road if possible
4. Maintain Largest Army advantage with additional knights when possible
5. Next major build should be a city upgrade when resources allow
</plan>

I'll build a road at edge (34, 35) to move closer to the wheat port.

RESPONSE:
# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to strategically place the robber to:
1. Disrupt RED player's production (they're leading with 7 VP and longest road)
2. Potentially steal a useful resource card from them
3. Block their highest-value hexes

Let me analyze the best options:

## RED's High-Value Production Hexes:
- 🧱8 [⭐⭐⭐] (0, 0, 0) at node 4
- 🌾8 [⭐⭐⭐] (-1, 0, 1) at nodes 4 and 17
- 🐑6 [⭐⭐⭐] (1, -1, 0) at node 8

## My Strategic Options:

**Option [0]**: Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED
- This blocks RED's 8-value brick production (⭐⭐⭐)
- Brick is critical for RED's road-building strategy
- Could significantly slow their longest road advantage

**Option [3]**: Move robber to (-1, 0, 1) and steal from RED
- This blocks RED's 8-value wheat production (⭐⭐⭐)
- Wheat is essential for settlements, cities, and development cards
- Also affects my own wheat production at node 12 (⭐⭐⭐)

**Option [1]**: Move robber to (1, -1, 0) and steal from RED
- This blocks RED's 6-value sheep production (⭐⭐⭐)
- Sheep is needed for development cards
- Could slow RED's ability to challenge my largest army advantage

Looking at RED's position, they have the longest road and are just 3 VP away from winning. Their optimal strategy likely involves:
1. Further expanding their road network
2. Building new settlements
3. Or upgrading to cities

To prevent these strategies:
- Blocking brick will slow road expansion
- Blocking wheat will slow settlement/city building

<plan>
1. Block RED's brick production to prevent them from extending their longest road
2. Continue gathering ore/wheat for city upgrades
3. Use wheat port to optimize resource conversion
4. Prepare for city upgrade when resources allow (need 3 ore + 2 wheat)
5. Watch for opportunity to break RED's longest road if possible
6. Maintain Largest Army advantage
</plan>

Since RED has 7 points with 5 settlements and longest road, their most likely path to victory is building additional settlements or securing development cards. Blocking their brick production will significantly hamper their ability to extend roads for new settlements.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

❓ Select action by number (0-1):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I need to analyze my position and options carefully to determine the optimal action.

Current Game State Analysis:
- I have 6 VP (4 settlements + 2 VP from Largest Army)
- I have resources: 3 Wood, 1 Sheep, 3 Wheat, 2 Ore
- RED has 7 VP (5 settlements + 2 VP from Longest Road)
- The robber is on the brick hex (0,0,0)
- I have enough resources to buy a development card (costs 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore)
- I don't have enough resources for a city (needs 3 Ore, 2 Wheat - I'm short 1 Ore)
- I can't build a settlement (need brick)
- I can't build a road (need brick)

Decision Analysis:
1. Buy Development Card (Option 1):
   - Potential outcomes: Victory Point card, Knight, Road Building, Year of Plenty, or Monopoly
   - A Victory Point card would put me at 7 VP
   - Another Knight would strengthen my Largest Army position
   - Year of Plenty or Monopoly could help get resources I need (especially brick)
   - Will use 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore, leaving me with 3 Wood, 2 Wheat, 1 Ore

2. End Turn (Option 0):
   - Retain all current resources
   - Risk losing half if someone rolls a 7
   - No immediate progress toward victory

Strategic Considerations:
- Development cards are my primary path to victory according to my strategy
- I already have Largest Army with 5 knights, so that advantage is secure
- I need to continue making progress toward 10 VP while preventing RED from reaching 10 VP
- Getting another development card aligns with my long-term victory plan
- With 18 development cards remaining, probability of useful card is high

<plan>
1. Buy development card hoping for VP card or utility card
2. Continue blocking RED's brick production with robber
3. Work toward city upgrade when resources allow (need 1 more ore)
4. Use wheat port strategically when necessary
5. Maintain Largest Army advantage
6. Look for opportunities to build toward favorable resource locations
</plan>

The optimal action is to buy a development card. This advances my development card strategy, reduces my hand size (protecting against 7s), and gives me a chance at a victory point or utility card to help with my resource constraints.

Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state and determine the optimal move:

## Game State Analysis
- I have 6 VP: 4 settlements (4 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 1 hidden VP card
- RED has 7 VP: 5 settlements (5 VP) + longest road (2 VP)
- RED has 12 cards in hand, making them vulnerable to a 7 roll
- The robber is currently on a brick hex (0,0,0), blocking RED's brick production
- I have: 3 wood, 1 sheep, 2 wheat, 1 ore

## Available Actions
1. Buy a development card (cost: 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore)
2. End my turn

## Development Card Analysis
- Buying a dev card could give me:
  - Victory Point card: Would get me to 7 VP total
  - Knight card: Would extend my largest army lead (currently at 5)
  - Year of Plenty: Useful resource boost
  - Monopoly: Could be powerful against RED's 12 cards
  - Road Building: Help expand toward new resources

## Strategic Considerations
- I'm 4 VP away from winning (need 10 VP)
- Buying a dev card uses all my sheep and ore, but I keep 1 wheat and 3 wood
- RED has a significant lead in settlements and longest road
- I have a wheat port which can help me convert excess wheat if needed
- I need more resources overall to make progress toward cities

<plan>
1. Buy development card hoping for VP card or knight
2. Continue blocking RED's brick production with robber
3. Build settlements at high-production nodes when possible
4. Work toward city upgrades (need ore + wheat)
5. Maintain Largest Army advantage
6. Use wheat port strategically when necessary
</plan>

## Decision
Given that RED is ahead with 7 VP to my 6 VP, and they have 12 cards in hand, the development card is clearly the optimal play. It gives me a chance at a VP card (immediate benefit), a knight (extending my army lead), or utility cards that could help me recover resources. Since I have limited build options otherwise, and development cards are my primary victory path, I should invest in them.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:

- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

RESPONSE:
# Game Analysis for Turn 65

I need to decide between playing a Knight card or rolling the dice. Let me analyze the current game state:

## Current Game State
- I'm BLUE with 6/10 victory points (1 hidden VP card)
- I have resources: 3 🌲WOOD, 3 🌾WHEAT
- I have 1 KNIGHT card and 1 VICTORY_POINT card
- RED has 8/10 victory points and holds the Longest Road bonus
- The robber is currently on the 🧱8 (0,0,0) hex, which is my brick production
- I already have Largest Army with 5 knights played

## Option 0: Play Knight Card
**Benefits:**
- Could move the robber from the 🧱8 hex to a more strategic location
- Could steal one of RED's 3 cards
- Would extend my Largest Army lead from 5 to 6 knights

**Drawbacks:**
- I don't urgently need to protect my production as the robber is on a hex I'm not producing from
- Using the knight now means I won't have it for defense if RED rolls a 7 later

## Option 1: Roll Dice
**Benefits:**
- Could gain more resources to potentially build something this turn
- Saving the Knight card for when I really need it
- RED only has 3 cards, so there's low risk of a harmful 7 roll

**Drawbacks:**
- No guarantee of rolling favorable numbers

## Strategic Considerations
RED is at 8 VP and could be close to winning. My priorities should be:
1. Move toward 10 VP myself (need 4 more)
2. Block RED's progress
3. Gather resources for city upgrades

If I roll now and get good resources, I could potentially build a settlement or work toward a city. The knight can be saved for defense or for a more critical moment.

<plan>
1. Roll the dice to gain resources
2. If possible, buy ore to work toward city upgrades
3. Move robber to RED's high-value hexes when needed
4. Continue to build toward upgrading settlements to cities
5. Save knight card for defensive purposes
6. Reveal VP card only when it gives me the win
</plan>

Given that I don't immediately need to move the robber (it's not blocking my production) and I could benefit from more resources by rolling, I'll choose to roll the dice.

# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to move the robber to maximize my chances of winning while hindering my opponent RED who is ahead at 8/10 VP.

## Current Game State Assessment
- RED has 8 VP (ahead of me by 2 points)
- I have 6 VP (4 settlements + largest army bonus)
- RED already has the longest road
- I have a hidden VP card, so I'm effectively at 7/10 VP
- The robber is currently on (0,0,0) which is a brick hex (8) - moving it is mandatory

## Strategic Priorities
1. Disrupt RED's resource production, especially high-value hexes
2. Target resources RED needs for potential winning moves
3. Steal a resource from RED if possible
4. Focus on high-probability numbers (6,8)

## Red's Settlements/Cities and Key Production
- Node 4: brick(8★★★), wheat(8★★★), ore(9★★)
- Node 8: sheep(6★★★), sheep(4★), wood(5★★) - This is a CITY
- Node 17: ore(9★★), sheep(3★), wheat(11★)
- Node 16: ore(9★★), brick(3★), sheep(10★)
- Node 19: brick(3★), wheat(9★★), brick(5★★)

Looking at RED's production, they produce from:
- Brick 8★★★ (high value)
- Wheat 8★★★ (high value)
- Ore 9★★ (appears twice)
- Sheep 6★★★ (high value)

## Robber Placement Options Analysis

The best targets are RED's high-probability hexes (especially 8s and 6s):
- Option [0]: Sheep 6★★★ hex (1,-1,0) - disrupts high-value sheep production from RED's city
- Option [2]: Wheat 8★★★ hex (-1,0,1) - disrupts high-value wheat production
- Option [3]: Ore 9★★ hex (-1,1,0) - disrupts ore that appears twice for RED

Among these, Option [2] targeting the wheat 8★★★ hex is especially strong because:
1. It blocks a high-probability resource (wheat is critical for development cards and cities)
2. Wheat 8★★★ is one of RED's best producing hexes
3. RED is at 8 VP and likely needs wheat for potential settlement or city builds
4. I can steal a card from RED
5. RED has multiple wheat-producing hexes, suggesting they might rely on this resource

<plan>
1. Move robber to RED's wheat 8★★★ hex to disrupt their potential city/development card strategy
2. Roll the dice to gain resources
3. Use my wheat, wood, and sheep to purchase development cards for potential VPs
4. Save knight card to protect my high-value hexes when needed
5. Consider city upgrade next turn if I gain ore
6. Only reveal VP card when it gives me the win
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I will move the robber to the wheat 8★★★ hex and steal from RED.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Turn Analysis for Blue Player

I'll analyze the current game state and my options to determine the best course of action.

## Current Game State Assessment:
- I have 6 VP (4 settlements + largest army)
- I have 1 hidden victory point card
- RED has 8 VP (4 settlements + 1 city + longest road)
- I have resources: 3 Wood, 3 Wheat, 1 Ore
- I own a Knight card and a Victory Point card
- The robber is currently on a wheat hex (-1, 0, 1) which is RED's high-value 8 wheat hex

## Available Options:
[0] Play Knight card - Move the robber and steal a resource
[1] End my turn

## Decision Analysis:

First, let me evaluate playing the Knight card:
- Benefits: 
  - I can steal a resource from RED (who only has 2 cards)
  - I can move the robber to disrupt RED's production further
  - The robber is already on RED's wheat 8 hex, but I could move it to another productive hex
  - This strengthens my largest army advantage

- Drawbacks:
  - I'd be using up a Knight that could be more valuable later
  - With only 2 cards, RED may not have a resource I need
  - No guarantee I'll steal something useful

Next, let me consider ending my turn:
- Benefits:
  - I keep my Knight card for potentially more strategic timing
  - I'll get resources on my next roll which could enable a city upgrade
- Drawbacks:
  - RED will get to roll and potentially gain resources before my next turn
  - RED is close to winning (8 VP)

Looking at my current resources (3 Wood, 3 Wheat, 1 Ore), I don't have enough for a city (3 Ore + 2 Wheat) or development card (1 Ore + 1 Wheat + 1 Sheep). I could build roads, but that doesn't advance me toward victory as effectively as other options.

RED is at 8 VP and could potentially win soon. Moving the robber is already limiting one of their productive hexes. Playing another Knight doesn't provide significant immediate advantage since I already have largest army secured with 5 knights.

<plan>
1. Save my knight card for when RED moves the robber to one of my productive hexes
2. Build city when I get enough ore (need 2 more)
3. Consider development cards if I get sheep
4. Only reveal VP card when it gives me the win
5. Watch for opportunity to block RED if they approach 10 VP
</plan>

Given these considerations, I'll save my Knight card for a more strategically important moment and simply end my turn to collect more resources on my next roll.

❓ Select action by number (0-1):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action for this turn.

## Current Game State Analysis
- I have 6 VP (4 settlements + largest army bonus)
- I'm holding 3 wood, 1 brick, 3 wheat, 1 ore, 1 knight card, and 1 victory point card
- RED has 8 VP (4 settlements + 1 city + longest road)
- RED is only 2 VP away from winning, making them a significant threat
- The robber is on hex (-1, 0, 1) which is a wheat 8 - this is blocking production on one of my high-value hexes

## Options Analysis
**Option 0: Play Knight Card**
- Benefits:
  - Can move the robber off my wheat 8 hex, unblocking my high production
  - Can steal a resource from RED
  - Could potentially set me up for a better roll outcome
  
**Option 1: Roll the Dice**
- Benefits:
  - Might get resources needed for a city (need 2 more ore)
  - Preserves knight card for future emergency
- Risks:
  - The robber stays on my wheat 8 hex, continuing to block production
  - Could roll a 7 which would make me discard half my cards

## Strategic Considerations
1. The robber is currently on my wheat 8 hex, which is one of my best production tiles
2. I need more ore (need 2 more) to build a city and increase VP
3. Moving the robber will unblock my wheat production, potentially helping me gather resources faster
4. I have enough cards (8) that I wouldn't need to discard on a 7 roll
5. RED is close to winning with 8 VP, so I need to accelerate my strategy

<plan>
1. Play knight now to unblock my wheat 8 hex and place robber on RED's best hex
2. Next priority: gather 2 more ore to build a city
3. Keep buying development cards when possible to maintain largest army and find VP cards
4. Only reveal my VP card when it gives me the win
5. Continue monitoring RED's progress - they're very close to winning
</plan>

Given the analysis, playing the knight card now is the optimal strategic move. It will unblock my valuable wheat resource and potentially steal a useful resource from RED. This sets me up for better production on future rolls.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and choose the best robber placement to maximize my chances of winning.

## Current Situation
- I have 6 VP (4 settlements + 2 from largest army)
- I have 1 hidden Victory Point card, bringing my actual total to 7 VP
- RED has 8 VP (4 settlements + 1 city + 2 from longest road) and is close to winning
- The robber is currently on the wheat 8 hex (-1, 0, 1), which is one of my valuable production tiles
- I need to move the robber to both protect my resources and hinder RED

## Red's Production
Let me identify RED's most valuable production hexes:
- 🧱 Brick 8: Node 4 (⭐⭐⭐)
- 🌾 Wheat 8: Node 4 (⭐⭐⭐) - Currently blocked by robber
- 🐑 Sheep 6: Node 8 (⭐⭐⭐)
- 🐑 Sheep 4: Node 8 (⭐)
- 🌲 Wood 5: Node 8 (⭐⭐)
- ⛏️ Ore 9: Nodes 4, 16, 17 (⭐⭐ each, appears on 3 different settlements)
- Various others with ⭐ or ⭐⭐

RED's most important resources appear to be Ore (from the 9 hex), Brick (from the 8 hex), and the Sheep/Wood combination from their city at node 8.

## My Path to Victory
- I need 3 more VP to win
- Options:
  1. Build a city (2 VP): Need 3 ore, 2 wheat (have 1 ore, 3 wheat)
  2. Build another settlement (1 VP) and reveal my VP card: Need 1 wood, 1 brick, 1 sheep, 1 wheat (have 3 wood, 1 brick, 0 sheep, 3 wheat)
  3. Buy more development cards hoping for VP cards or knights to secure largest army

## Best Robber Placement

I should place the robber on one of RED's most valuable hexes:
- The brick 8 (0,0,0) hex is extremely valuable to RED (⭐⭐⭐)
- The ore 9 (-1,1,0) hex is important as it serves three of RED's settlements
- The sheep 6 (1,-1,0) hex supports RED's city

Given that RED has 8 VP and is close to winning, I should target their most productive hex that doesn't hurt me.

Option [0] - placing the robber on brick 8 (0,0,0) and stealing from RED seems best because:
1. It blocks a ⭐⭐⭐ resource for RED
2. It doesn't block any of my own resources
3. I might steal a valuable resource from RED
4. Brick is crucial for RED if they want to build more roads/settlements

<plan>
1. Move robber to RED's brick 8 hex to block their high-value production
2. Focus on gathering 2 more ore to build a city (need 3 ore total)
3. Continue buying development cards when possible to maintain largest army
4. Only reveal my VP card when it gives me the win
5. Watch RED's progress closely - they're dangerously close to winning
</plan>

# Game Analysis and Strategy Planning

Let me analyze the current game state and available options to determine the optimal action.

## Current Game State
- I (BLUE) have 6 VP: 4 settlements (4 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 1 hidden VP card
- RED has 8 VP: 4 settlements (4 VP) + 1 city (2 VP) + longest road (2 VP)
- RED is 2 points ahead and dangerously close to winning
- The robber is currently on the 🧱8 hex, which is already blocking a high-value resource
- I have 3 🌲WOOD, 2 🧱BRICK, 3 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE

## Development Card Strategy Assessment
- My previous plan mentioned gathering ore to build a city (need 3 ore total, have 1)
- I need 2 more ore for a city, which would give me +1 VP (bringing me to 7 VP)
- Building a city is critical for my victory path, but I don't have enough ore now
- I could buy a development card (1 🐑SHEEP, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE), but I don't have sheep

## Road Building Options
Looking at my road building options, I need to consider:
1. Does any road position me to build a settlement soon?
2. Does any road help me work toward longest road (currently need 5 more roads to tie)?
3. Is building a road the best use of my resources right now?

I have enough resources (3 wood, 2 brick) to build two roads, but I should save some resources for future turns unless I have an immediate strategic advantage.

## Best Path to Victory
My current situation suggests I need to:
1. Increase my ore production to build cities
2. Position myself for another settlement (need to reach 10 VP)
3. Protect my future development potential

Since I can't build a city or buy a development card right now, I should focus on positioning for my next settlement or protecting my position against RED.

## Road Building Analysis
Looking at the options:
- Edge (0, 20) connects to node 20, which borders 🧱3, 🌲4, and is near a 🧱5 hex
- Edge (0, 5) connects to node 5, which borders 🧱3 and ⛏️9
- Edge (2, 3) seems to move toward the center of the board
- Edge (14, 37) moves toward the 3:1 port

None of these roads seems to give me an immediate settlement opportunity, and I'm still 5 roads away from matching RED's longest road. With RED at 8 VP, they could win soon, so I should be conservative with resources.

## Decision
Given my current position, the best strategy is to **end my turn** and save my resources. This allows me to maintain flexibility for building a city once I get more ore, or responding to game developments.

<plan>
1. End turn to conserve resources - I can't make any critical builds now
2. Continue focusing on gathering 2 more ore to build a city
3. If I roll ore on the next turn, prioritize city building
4. If I roll sheep on the next turn, consider buying a development card
5. Watch RED's progress carefully - they need only 2 more points to win
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 69 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. End turn to conserve resources - I can't make any critical builds now
2. Continue focusing on gathering 2 more ore to build a city
3. If I roll ore on the next turn, prioritize city building
4. If I roll sheep on the next turn, consider buying a development card
5. Watch RED's progress carefully - they need only 2 more points to win
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis

I need to carefully analyze the current game state and determine the optimal action to maximize my chances of winning.

## Game State Summary
- I (BLUE) have 6 visible victory points (4 settlements + 2 for largest army) and 1 hidden VP from a development card = 7 VP total
- RED has 8 VP (4 settlements + 1 city + 2 for longest road)
- I need 3 more VP to win, RED needs 2 more VP
- Resources: 4 WOOD, 2 BRICK, 1 SHEEP, 3 WHEAT, 1 ORE
- Robber is on the BRICK hex (0,0,0), potentially limiting brick production
- I have the largest army with 6 knights

## My Path to Victory
To reach 10 VP, I need 3 more points. Options include:
1. Build 3 more settlements (+3 VP)
2. Upgrade 1-2 settlements to cities (+1-2 VP) and build 1-2 more settlements
3. Buy more development cards hoping for VP cards

## Action Analysis

### Option 0: End Turn
- Conserves resources but doesn't advance my position
- I have enough resources for several possible plays, so ending turn would waste opportunity

### Options 1-10: Build Road
- Would use 1 WOOD + 1 BRICK, leaving 3 WOOD + 1 BRICK
- Building a road doesn't give immediate VP but could position for future settlement
- With 7 roads currently, I need 5 more to challenge RED for longest road
- Not immediately helpful for winning unless part of a longer strategy

### Option 11: Buy Development Card
- Costs 1 SHEEP + 1 WHEAT + 1 ORE
- This would use all my SHEEP and ORE, leaving me with 4 WOOD, 2 BRICK, 2 WHEAT
- Development card could be:
  - VP card (25% chance) - immediate hidden point
  - Knight (50% chance) - strengthens largest army
  - Monopoly/Road Building/Year of Plenty (25% chance) - useful utility

### Options 12-15: Maritime Trade
- Trading 4 WOOD for resources is inefficient
- None of these trades enable a strategic build

## Strategic Decision

With RED at 8 VP and needing only 2 more points, I need to accelerate my path to victory.

I already have 7 VP total (6 visible + 1 hidden). My best path is likely to build cities (2 VP each) since I already have 4 settlements.

My priority should be gathering ore for city upgrades. Currently I only have 1 ORE, so buying a development card would use my only ORE, delaying city building.

However, buying a development card has a 25% chance of giving me another VP card, bringing me to 8 VP. It also has a 50% chance of giving me a knight, which would further secure my largest army advantage.

With RED so close to winning, taking a calculated risk with a development card purchase is reasonable, especially since I can't build a city this turn anyway.

<plan>
1. Buy a development card this turn to possibly get another VP or knight
2. Focus on gathering ore (need 3 more) for my first city upgrade
3. Watch RED's progress carefully - they're just 2 points away from winning
4. Aim for cities rather than new settlements for faster VP gain
</plan>

Therefore, I choose to buy a development card:

- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 69 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Buy a development card this turn to possibly get another VP or knight
2. Focus on gathering ore (need 3 more) for my first city upgrade
3. Watch RED's progress carefully - they're just 2 points away from winning
4. Aim for cities rather than new settlements for faster VP gain
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis - Settlers of Catan

Let me carefully analyze the current game state and my available options.

## Game Status Summary
- I (BLUE) have 6 VP: 4 settlements (4 VP) + Largest Army (2 VP)
- I have 1 hidden Victory Point card, so effectively I'm at 7 VP
- RED has 8 VP: 4 settlements (4 VP) + 1 city (2 VP) + Longest Road (2 VP)
- Resources: 4 Wood, 2 Brick, 2 Wheat
- Development cards: 1 Knight, 1 Victory Point
- Robber is at (0,0,0) - blocking the 8-value Brick hex

## Strategic Considerations
1. RED is at 8 VP and likely close to winning - they need just 2 more VP
2. I need 3 more VP to win (effectively at 7 VP with hidden VP card)
3. Best paths to victory:
   - Build 1-2 more settlements (+1-2 VP)
   - Upgrade settlements to cities (+1 VP each)
   - Get more development cards for potential VP cards
4. The robber is currently blocking one of my resources (brick) on a high-probability hex

## Available Actions Analysis

**End Turn [0]** - Not optimal as I have resources to use.

**Road Building [1-10]** - I have enough resources (4 wood, 2 brick) to build 2 roads, but:
- I don't have resources to build a settlement after making roads
- Road building without follow-up settlement doesn't gain VPs directly
- RED already has Longest Road, and I'm far behind (4 vs 8)

**Maritime Trade [11-14]** - I could trade 4 wood for 1 ore, which would give me:
- 2 Brick, 2 Wheat, 1 Ore
- This doesn't enable any immediate high-value builds

## Optimal Strategy

Looking at my current resources and position:
1. I can't build any settlements right now (need brick+wood+wheat+sheep)
2. I can't build a city (need 3 ore + 2 wheat, I only have 2 wheat and no ore)
3. I could build roads, but this doesn't advance my VP total

The most valuable action would be to end my turn and preserve my resources for a more strategic build later. I should continue focusing on getting ore to upgrade my settlements to cities.

<plan>
1. End turn to preserve resources
2. Focus on acquiring ore for city upgrades (3 ore needed)
3. Consider playing my knight card if the robber threatens key production
4. Save resources for development cards if ore becomes available
5. Watch RED carefully - they only need 2 more VP to win
</plan>

Since I can't make a high-value build this turn, the best option is to end my turn.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road

- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points

# Game State Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state and my options thoroughly:

## Current Status
- I (BLUE) have 6/10 VP: 4 settlements (4 VP) + Largest Army (2 VP) + 1 hidden Victory Point card
- RED has 9/10 VP: 3 settlements (3 VP) + 2 cities (4 VP) + Longest Road (2 VP)
- RED only needs 1 more VP to win - they're very close to victory
- Resources in hand: 4 Wood, 2 Brick, 4 Wheat
- Development cards: 1 Knight, 1 Victory Point (hidden)

## My Options
1. **Play Knight card**: I could move the robber to block production and steal from RED
2. **Roll dice**: Standard turn flow - roll and collect resources

## Strategic Considerations

The robber is currently on (0,0,0) which is a Brick hex with an 8 value. This is blocking:
- RED's settlement at node 4 (which produces Brick 8)
- My settlement at node 1 (which also produces Brick 8)

RED is one point away from winning, so blocking their high-value production is critical. However, the robber is already on one of RED's best hexes.

If I roll and get a bad number like 7, I'll need to move the robber and might lose resources. With 10 cards in hand, I'm at risk if a 7 is rolled.

Playing my Knight now would:
1. Allow me to move the robber to another high-value hex for RED
2. Let me steal one of their resources
3. Preserve my resource advantage
4. Not risk losing cards to a 7 roll

Since RED only needs 1 more VP to win, playing defensively is crucial. I should play my Knight card to disrupt their production.

<plan>
1. Play Knight card to move robber to another high-value hex for RED (like Wheat 8 or Sheep 6)
2. Continue focusing on upgrading settlements to cities (need ore)
3. Consider buying development cards with excess sheep/wheat when I get ore
4. Try to reach 10 VP through: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + Largest Army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards (2 VP)
</plan>

2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 71 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Play Knight card to move robber to another high-value hex for RED (like Wheat 8 or Sheep 6)
2. Continue focusing on upgrading settlements to cities (need ore)
3. Consider buying development cards with excess sheep/wheat when I get ore
4. Try to reach 10 VP through: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + Largest Army (2 VP) + 2 VP cards (2 VP)
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Analyzing Robber Placement Options

I need to carefully assess where to place the robber to maximize my advantage against RED, who is at 9 VP and close to winning.

## Game State Assessment
- RED has 9/10 VP (3 settlements + 2 cities + Longest Road)
- I have 6/10 VP (4 settlements + Largest Army + 1 hidden VP card)
- RED's production is strong in brick (8), wheat (8), and sheep (6)
- The robber is currently on the brick 8 hex, which is good placement

## Strategic Considerations
1. Target RED's highest value production hexes
2. Prioritize resources RED needs to win (settlement/road materials)
3. Avoid blocking my own production
4. Choose a hex that allows stealing from RED

## Evaluating RED's Key Production Hexes
- Wheat 8 (hex -1,0,1): RED has settlement at node 4 (⭐⭐⭐ production)
- Sheep 6 (hex 1,-1,0): RED has city at node 8 (⭐⭐⭐ production)
- Brick 8 (hex 0,0,0): Already blocked by robber
- Ore 9 (hex -1,1,0): RED has two settlements (nodes 16 & 17)

## Best Robber Placements

### Option 2: Move robber to (-1,0,1) - Wheat 8 hex
- This blocks RED's ⭐⭐⭐ wheat production at node 4
- Wheat is critical for development cards and settlements
- I also have a settlement on this hex, but blocking RED is worth it

### Option 0: Move robber to (1,-1,0) - Sheep 6 hex
- This blocks RED's ⭐⭐⭐ sheep production from their city at node 8
- Sheep is needed for development cards and settlements
- I also have a settlement on this hex

### Option 3: Move robber to (-1,1,0) - Ore 9 hex
- This blocks RED's double ore production (nodes 16 & 17)
- Ore is critical for cities, which RED needs to win

## Decision
The wheat 8 hex is the most crucial target because:
1. It's RED's highest-value wheat production (⭐⭐⭐)
2. RED needs wheat for either a settlement or development card to win
3. Blocking their most productive wheat hex significantly slows their progress

<plan>
1. Move robber to Wheat 8 (RED's critical production)
2. Continue focusing on upgrading settlements to cities using ore/wheat
3. Save brick/wood for strategic settlement placement
4. Keep buying development cards when possible to maintain largest army
5. Path to victory: 4 settlements (4 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 1 VP card + 1-2 cities (2-4 VP)
</plan>

I choose to move the robber to the wheat 8 hex at coordinates (-1,0,1), which is action number 2.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):

# Game Analysis & Decision

Let me analyze my current position and available options:

## Game State Analysis
- I have 6 visible VP (4 settlements + 2 for largest army) and 1 hidden VP card = 7 VP total
- RED has 9 VP (3 settlements + 2 cities + 2 for longest road) and is only 1 VP away from winning
- I have 4 WOOD, 2 BRICK, 4 WHEAT resources
- RED has only 1 card, so they're not an immediate threat unless they draw exactly what they need

## Resource Assessment
- I have enough resources to build a road (1 wood, 1 brick)
- I don't have sheep or ore, so I can't build a settlement, city, or development card

## Strategic Options
1. **Build a Road**: Use my wood and brick to extend my network
2. **Trade Resources**: Convert some resources to get closer to a settlement or development card
3. **End Turn**: Save resources for a more impactful move next turn

## Evaluating Road Building Options
Looking at the available road edges:
- Edge (14, 37) leads toward the wheat port (32, 33) which could be valuable
- Edge (35, 36) would connect me to a 3:1 port
- Edge (0, 5) could eventually lead to a settlement spot with brick production

## Evaluating Trading Options
- With 4 wood, I could trade for ore to get closer to a city upgrade
- With 4 wheat, I could trade for sheep to get closer to a development card

## RED's Threat
RED has 9 VP and could win on their next turn. As they only have 1 card, they likely need to gather resources to win. I should use my turn effectively.

## Decision Analysis
Trading doesn't get me to an immediate build (settlement, city, or development card), so it's better to progress toward a new building opportunity.

Building a road toward potential new settlement locations or valuable ports makes the most sense. Edge (14, 37) appears most strategic as it leads toward the wheat port, which would be valuable for city upgrades.

## Updated Strategic Plan
<plan>
1. Build road toward wheat port (2:1) to improve trading efficiency
2. Focus on upgrading settlements to cities (need ore)
3. Continue buying development cards when possible
4. Target 10 VP through: 4 settlements (4 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 1 VP card + at least 1-2 cities (2-4 VP)
</plan>

After careful consideration, I'll build a road at edge (14, 37) to expand toward the wheat port:

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

❓ Select action by number (0-15):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze this game state step by step to determine the best action.

## Game State Assessment

1. **Victory Points**:
   - BLUE (me): 6/10 VP (4 settlements + largest army + 1 hidden VP card)
   - RED: 9/10 VP (very close to winning)

2. **My Resources**:
   - 3 🌲WOOD, 1 🧱BRICK, 4 🌾WHEAT
   - This allows me to build a road (1🌲 + 1🧱) with resources left over

3. **Board Position**:
   - RED is at 9/10 VP and has longest road
   - I have largest army with 7 knights
   - Robber is at (-1, 0, 1) on a wheat hex

4. **Critical Urgency Assessment**:
   - RED needs only 1 more VP to win
   - I need 4 more VP to win (already have 6)

## Strategic Options

1. **End Turn (Action 0)**: This wastes resources and gives RED another turn to potentially win.

2. **Build Road (Actions 1-11)**:
   - This would use my brick and some wood, leaving me with 2 wood and 4 wheat
   - Does not immediately increase my VP count
   - Could potentially set me up for a future settlement
   - Most importantly, could prevent RED from winning if I block a critical expansion path

3. **Maritime Trade (Actions 12-15)**:
   - Trading wheat for other resources
   - Not useful unless I have a specific build plan

## Strategic Plan Analysis

My current plan is:
1. Build road toward wheat port
2. Focus on upgrading settlements to cities
3. Continue buying development cards
4. Target 10 VP through settlements + largest army + 1 VP card + cities

Given that RED is at 9 VP, I need to be extremely defensive while still advancing my position. Building a road is my only viable building option with current resources.

To analyze road options, I need to:
1. Block RED's potential expansion paths
2. Position myself for future settlement builds
3. Work toward wheat port access

Looking at the road options and the board description:
- Road options 8 (edge 33, 34) seems aligned with my plan to build toward the wheat port, as node 32, 33 is listed as the wheat port location
- Other roads might block RED or help me expand in other directions

<plan>
1. Build road toward wheat port at edge (33, 34) this turn
2. Save wheat for potential development card (need sheep & ore) or settlement (need more resources)
3. Focus on securing more ore production to enable city upgrades
4. Defensively prevent RED from reaching 10 VP at all costs
</plan>

Since RED is at 9 VP, I need to be very careful about my moves. Building a road toward the wheat port matches my current plan and provides future trading efficiency. The wheat port will allow me to trade 2 wheat for 1 of any other resource, which is valuable since I have good wheat production.

Therefore, I'll choose action 8 to build a road at edge (33, 34), continuing my path toward the wheat port.

# Game Analysis for Current Turn

Let me analyze the current game state and my available options:

## Current Game State
- RED is at 9 VP (close to winning)
- I (BLUE) have 6 VP + 1 hidden VP from a VP card = 7 VP total
- I need 3 more VP to win
- I have 2 🌲WOOD and 4 🌾WHEAT resources
- Robber is on wheat hex (-1, 0, 1) which is one of my productive hexes
- RED has longest road (2 VP)
- I have largest army (2 VP)

## Resource Assessment
- I have 2 wood and 4 wheat
- I'm missing sheep, ore, and brick for further development
- I have a wheat port at nodes 32, 33 (I have a settlement at 34, which is adjacent)

## Available Actions
- I can end my turn [0]
- I could trade 4 wheat for resources via standard 4:1 trade [1-4]

## Strategic Options Analysis
1. End my turn and save resources
   - Pros: Keep wheat for future development card (need sheep & ore) or settlement
   - Cons: Not making progress this turn

2. Trade 4 wheat for another resource
   - Pros: Could get a needed resource
   - Cons: Very inefficient 4:1 trade; would leave me with only 2 wood and the traded resource

Looking at my current plan, I want to build a road toward the wheat port (33, 34). However, I already have a settlement at node 34, and the wheat port is at nodes 32-33. My road network doesn't show exactly, but the plan suggests I need to build toward the wheat port.

Given that RED is at 9 VP and very close to winning, I need to be cautious about my resource management.

Let me evaluate my position more carefully:
- I have 4 settlements (4 VP)
- I have largest army (2 VP)
- I have 1 VP card (1 VP)
- Total: 7 VP

To get to 10 VP, I need 3 more VP, which could come from:
- 1 city upgrade (1 more VP)
- 1 additional settlement (1 VP)
- 1 more VP card (1 VP)
- Or taking longest road from RED (would be +4 VP swing)

Since I have a wheat port adjacent to my settlement at 34, but my plan mentions building a road toward this port, it seems there may be a disconnect. The wheat port is already accessible to me for 2:1 wheat trades, but I can't use it this turn since I only have 4 wheat (need 2 for a 2:1 trade).

Given the information available and my limited options, I believe the best course is to end my turn and save my resources for a more meaningful play next turn.

<plan>
1. Save resources this turn (especially wheat for development cards)
2. Next turn, aim to buy a development card if possible (need sheep & ore)
3. Focus on securing more ore production to enable city upgrades
4. If opportunity arises, block RED's potential expansion or disrupt their longest road
5. Continue defensive play to prevent RED from reaching 10 VP
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis: Blue Player Turn 73

## Current Game State Assessment
- I'm BLUE with 6 VP (4 settlements + largest army bonus)
- RED has 9 VP (3 settlements + 2 cities + longest road bonus)
- I have 2 wood, 1 brick, 4 wheat, plus 1 hidden victory point card
- The robber is blocking wheat production on the 8 wheat hex (-1,0,1)
- RED is 1 point away from winning

## Resource Assessment
My current resources (2 wood, 1 brick, 4 wheat) allow me to:
- Build a road (costs 1 wood, 1 brick)
- Trade wheat at 4:1 ratio for any resource

## Strategic Options Analysis

1. **Build a road option**
   - I could build a road to maintain expansion possibilities
   - This would use all my wood and brick
   - The best road placement would be strategic for future settlements or to potentially contest longest road
   - However, this doesn't bring me closer to a VP this turn

2. **End turn and save resources**
   - Saving resources would allow me to possibly buy a development card next turn (if I get sheep and ore)
   - Development cards are my most efficient path to victory given my current strategy
   - I need to accumulate ore and sheep for development cards

3. **Maritime trade**
   - I could trade 4 wheat for 1 sheep/ore to help with development card purchase
   - However, this is very inefficient trading and would deplete my wheat reserves

## Winning Path Analysis
RED is at 9 VP and likely to win next turn. My path to 10 VP requires:
- Current: 4 settlements (4 VP) + largest army (2 VP) + 1 victory point card = 7 VP
- Need: 3 more VP through either cities, settlements, victory point cards, or longest road

## Decision
Given that RED is one point from winning, and I cannot make significant progress toward victory this turn, my best option is to preserve resources for development cards on my next turn. Trading wheat at a 4:1 ratio is inefficient, and building a road doesn't immediately help my position.

<plan>
1. End turn to preserve resources
2. On next turn, aim to buy development cards with any sheep/ore I collect
3. Look for opportunities to upgrade settlements to cities
4. Continue defensive play against RED's expansion
5. Watch for opportunities to disrupt RED's longest road

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan - Turn 75

I'll analyze the current game state, resources, and potential actions to determine the optimal move.

## Current Situation
- I have 6 VP: 4 VP from settlements + 2 VP from largest army + 1 hidden VP card
- RED has 9 VP and is just 1 point away from winning
- I have 2 wood, 1 brick, 3 wheat resources
- The robber is on a wood hex at (1, 0, -1)
- RED has longest road (9 segments), giving them +2 VP

## Options Evaluation

1. **End Turn** (Action 0)
   - This preserves my current resources for future possibilities
   - With 3 wheat, I'm close to being able to buy a development card
   - Development cards could give me more victory points or knights to maintain largest army

2. **Build Road** (Actions 1-11)
   - I have exactly 2 wood, 1 brick - enough for one road
   - Building a road doesn't directly increase my VP count
   - It doesn't significantly improve my position since I'm not close to longest road
   - Most roads don't lead to valuable settlement locations

## Strategic Considerations

RED is at 9 VP and will likely win on their next turn. I need to focus on maximizing my chances of interrupting their win or accelerating my own path to victory.

With my current resources, I can't:
- Build a settlement (need wood, brick, wheat, sheep)
- Upgrade to a city (need 3 ore, 2 wheat)
- Buy a development card (need wheat, sheep, ore)

Since I have a hidden victory point, I'm actually at 7/10 VP, not 6/10. I need 3 more points to win.

## Decision Logic

Building a road now doesn't advance my immediate winning strategy and leaves me with fewer resources for future opportunities. My current plan should focus on gathering resources for development cards or city upgrades.

The best move is to end my turn, preserving resources for future opportunities. This is consistent with my existing plan to "End turn to preserve resources" and "On next turn, aim to buy development cards with any sheep/ore I collect."

<plan>
1. End turn to preserve my wood/brick/wheat resources
2. Hope to collect sheep and ore on next turns for development cards
3. Continue defensive play against RED's expansion
4. If I get the right resources, upgrade settlements to cities (especially those near wheat/ore)
5. Watch for opportunities to disrupt RED's longest road
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Situation Analysis

Let me analyze the current game state to make the optimal decision:

## Victory Point Status
- RED: 9/10 VP (very close to winning)
- BLUE (me): 6/10 VP (3 points behind)
  - 4 VP from settlements
  - 2 VP from largest army
  - 1 hidden VP from a development card

## Resources
- I have: 2 WOOD, 1 BRICK, 5 WHEAT
- RED has 9 cards (unknown)

## Strategic Analysis
1. RED is at 9 points and could win on their next turn
2. With my resources, I can build one road (1 WOOD, 1 BRICK)
3. I have 5 WHEAT but no other resources to use for development cards or upgrades
4. The robber is on a WOOD hex (1,0,-1), blocking my settlement at node 1

## Possible Actions
1. End turn (preserving resources)
2. Build a road (using my WOOD and BRICK)
3. Maritime trade using WHEAT (not very efficient)

## Decision Process
RED is one point away from victory, so I need to consider both offensive moves (increasing my points) and defensive moves (preventing RED from winning).

Building a road doesn't immediately help me gain points. I'd need more roads to potentially claim longest road, and RED already has 9 road segments.

Trading 4 WHEAT for 1 resource via maritime trade is inefficient and doesn't enable any immediate builds or strategic plays.

Looking at my current plan:
1. Preserving resources for future development card purchases seems wise
2. I need sheep and ore for development cards
3. With RED so close to winning, I should be defensive

Since I can't make any point-scoring moves this turn, and can't effectively block RED's potential victory, the best strategy is to preserve my valuable wood/brick/wheat combo and wait for my next dice roll.

<plan>
1. End turn to preserve my wood/brick/wheat resources
2. Hope to collect sheep and ore on next turns for development cards
3. Save resources to upgrade settlements to cities when possible
4. Keep building development cards to maintain largest army advantage
5. Watch for opportunities to disrupt RED's potential winning move

2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

# Initial Placement Strategy Analysis

I need to carefully analyze the board to choose the optimal location for my first settlement, focusing on accessing high-probability numbers (6 & 8), prioritizing ore and wheat, ensuring resource diversity, and positioning for future expansion.

## Resource Distribution Analysis
- High-value spots with 6/8 probability:
  - 🌾8 (0, 0, 0) - Wheat with 8 probability
  - 🧱8 (-1, 0, 1) - Brick with 8 probability
  - 🌲6 (0, 1, -1) - Wood with 6 probability

## Red's Position
Red has placed at node 0, which gives them access to:
- 🌾8 (0, 0, 0) - Wheat
- 🌲6 (0, 1, -1) - Wood
- 🐑9 (1, 0, -1) - Sheep

## Top Settlement Candidates

1. **Node 4** - Intersection of:
   - 🌾8 (0, 0, 0) - Wheat (probability 8)
   - 🌲2 (-1, 1, 0) - Wood (probability 2)
   - 🧱8 (-1, 0, 1) - Brick (probability 8)
   - Access to three resources with two high-value numbers

2. **Node 11** - Intersection of:
   - 🌾8 (0, 0, 0) - Wheat (probability 8)
   - 🌾9 (0, -1, 1) - Wheat (probability 9)
   - ⛏️10 (0, -2, 2) - Ore (probability 10)
   - Strong wheat production plus ore access

3. **Node 13** - Intersection of:
   - 🧱8 (-1, 0, 1) - Brick (probability 8)
   - 🌾3 (-1, -1, 2) - Wheat (probability 3)
   - 🐑11 (-2, 0, 2) - Sheep (probability 11)
   - Access to three different resources, plus proximity to wheat port

4. **Node 5** - Intersection of:
   - 🌾8 (0, 0, 0) - Wheat (probability 8)
   - 🌲2 (-1, 1, 0) - Wood (probability 2)
   - 🌲6 (0, 1, -1) - Wood (probability 6)
   - Good wheat and wood production

5. **Node 15** - Intersection of:
   - 🧱8 (-1, 0, 1) - Brick (probability 8)
   - 🌲2 (-1, 1, 0) - Wood (probability 2)
   - ⛏️10 (-2, 1, 1) - Ore (probability 10)
   - Strong brick and ore production

## Decision Analysis

According to my development card strategy, I need access to ore, wheat, and sheep. For my initial placement:

- Node 4 gives me wheat, brick, and wood, all with decent probabilities (two 8s)
- Node 11 gives me wheat and ore, but lacks resource diversity
- Node 15 gives me brick, wood, and ore with good probabilities (8 and 10)

Looking at ports, Node 38/39 is near the wheat port, which could be valuable if I produce excess wheat. Node 32/33 is near the wood port.

For my first settlement, I believe node 4 offers the best combination of high-probability numbers (two 8s), decent resource diversity (wheat, brick, wood), and strategic position for future expansion.

<plan>
1. Place first settlement at node 4 to secure wheat(8), brick(8), and wood(2)
2. For second settlement, aim for a spot with ore and sheep access
3. Focus on development card strategy by collecting ore, wheat, and sheep
4. Build cities on high-producing settlements
5. Pursue largest army victory point bonus
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

❓ Select action by number (0-2):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I need to decide on the best direction for my initial road placement from my first settlement at node 4. This will set up my expansion path for my second settlement.

Let me analyze the three options:

[0] Edge (4, 15): This road would lead toward the east side of the board, connecting to node 15. From there, I could potentially reach nodes like 17 (connecting to ore-10 and brick-6) or 16 (connecting to wood-6).

[1] Edge (4, 5): This road would lead toward the south side, connecting to node 5. This path would eventually lead to node 16 (connecting to wood-6) or toward node 0 (which already has RED's settlement).

[2] Edge (3, 4): This road would lead toward the west side, connecting to node 3. From there, I could potentially reach node 2 (wheat-9 and ore-12) or 12 (wheat-9 and sheep-11).

Strategic considerations:
- I need to prioritize accessing ore and sheep resources for my second settlement since my first settlement already has good wheat and brick production.
- According to my development card strategy, I need ore, wheat, and sheep.
- I should avoid building toward RED's settlement.
- I should look for high-probability numbers (6 and 8) that I don't already have.

Looking at the board:
- Option [0] leads toward ore-10, which is a decent ore source.
- Option [1] isn't very promising since it leads toward RED's settlement or limited expansion.
- Option [2] leads toward ore-12 (low probability) but also wheat-9 and sheep-9/11, which could be valuable.

For my development card strategy, option [2] gives me the best chance to secure ore and sheep resources that I'm currently missing. This would set me up to build my second settlement at a location that provides ore and sheep access, completing my resource diversity.

<plan>
1. Place first settlement at node 4 securing wheat(8), brick(8), and wood(2)
2. Build initial road toward node 3 to set up for accessing ore and sheep resources
3. Place second settlement at a location with ore and sheep access (likely near nodes 2 or 12)
4. Focus on development card strategy by collecting ore, wheat, and sheep
5. Build cities on high-producing settlements
6. Pursue largest army victory point bonus
</plan>

Following this plan, I should choose option [2] to build my initial road at edge (3, 4).

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

# Initial Settlement Analysis for Second Settlement

I need to place my second initial settlement strategically to complement my first settlement and set up a strong resource base for our development card strategy.

## Current Resources
- First settlement at node 4 produces wheat(8), brick(8), and wood(2)
- Already strong on wheat and brick (both 8s)
- Wood production is weak (2 is lowest probability)
- Completely lacking ore and sheep, which are critical for development cards

## Key Principles for Second Settlement
- Need access to ore and sheep
- Should prioritize high-probability numbers (5, 6, 8, 9)
- Should avoid duplicating numbers I already have (8, 2)
- Consider port access if possible
- Need balanced resource collection

## Node Analysis for Priority Resources

Looking at nodes with ore and/or sheep access with good probability:
- Node 22: Connects to sheep(9), sheep(11), and wood(4)
- Node 23: Connects to sheep(9), sheep(11), and sheep(5)
- Node 13: Connects to sheep(11), wheat(3), and brick(8)
- Node 14: Connects to sheep(11), ore(10), and brick(8)
- Node 17: Connects to ore(10), brick(6), and wood(2)
- Node 11: Connects to ore(10), wheat(9), and wheat(3)
- Node 12: Connects to ore(12), wheat(9), and wheat(3)

Evaluating resource combinations and probabilities:
- Node 14 offers sheep(11) and ore(10) - both needed resources with decent probabilities
- Also provides brick(8) which complements our strategy, giving us multiple brick sources
- Positions us well for future expansion
- Proximity to the sheep port (nodes 35-36)

<plan>
1. Place first settlement at node 4 securing wheat(8), brick(8), and wood(2)
2. Place second settlement at node 14 securing sheep(11), ore(10), and brick(8)
3. Focus on development card strategy by collecting ore, wheat, and sheep
4. Build cities on high-producing settlements
5. Target the largest army victory point bonus
6. Consider expanding toward the sheep port if we have excess sheep production
</plan>

Node 14 is the optimal choice as it provides:
1. The key missing resources (ore and sheep)
2. Good number diversity (8, 10, 11)
3. Multiple resource types
4. Positioning for future expansion
5. Potential access to sheep port

# Game Analysis for Initial Road Placement

I need to choose the best location for my initial road from my second settlement at node 14, which connects to brick(8), sheep(11), and ore(10).

## Analyzing Available Options:
- [0] Road at edge (13, 14): Extends toward my wheat/brick settlement at node 4
- [1] Road at edge (14, 37): Moves toward the sheep port at nodes 35/36
- [2] Road at edge (14, 15): Moves toward the wheat port at nodes 38/39

## Strategic Considerations:

1. **Development Card Strategy**: My plan focuses on development cards, requiring ore/wheat/sheep. Road placement should support access to these resources.

2. **Resource Analysis**:
   - I already have good brick (8) and wheat (8) production
   - I have moderate sheep (11) and ore (10) production
   - I'm weakest in wood production (only 2)

3. **Expansion Potential**:
   - Option 0: Connects my settlements but doesn't open new resource opportunities
   - Option 1: Moves toward sheep port (valuable given my sheep production) and opens possible expansion into more resources
   - Option 2: Moves toward wheat port and potential future settlements

## Decision Logic:
Since my plan focuses on development cards (requiring ore, wheat, sheep), extending toward the sheep port with option [1] aligns best with my strategy. This helps maximize my sheep usage when I have excess, improves trading efficiency, and keeps expansion options open.

<plan>
1. Build first road at edge (14, 37) toward the sheep port
2. Focus on getting ore, wheat, and sheep for development cards
3. Build cities on my high-producing settlements
4. Target the largest army victory point bonus
5. Consider expanding toward the sheep port when resources allow
6. Look for opportunities to add wood production in future expansion
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

RESPONSE:
# Game Analysis - Settlers of Catan Turn 9

I'll analyze the current game state and make a strategic decision for this turn.

## Current Resources
- I have: 3 brick, 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore
- These resources can be used to buy 1 development card (costs 1 sheep, 1 wheat, 1 ore)

## Victory Point Status
- I have 2 VP from my 2 settlements
- RED has 4 VP (2 from settlements + 2 from longest road)
- I'm behind by 2 points

## Production Analysis
- My settlements produce: 🧱8 (both settlements), 🌾8, 🐑11, ⛏️10, 🌲2
- I have good brick production, but limited sheep, wheat, and ore
- RED has strong wheat production at node 0 (🌾8)

## Development Card Strategy Assessment
Looking at my current plan, I'm focusing on development cards to pursue largest army. Development cards could provide:
- Knight cards (to move the robber and build toward largest army)
- Victory point cards (hidden points)
- Year of Plenty/Monopoly cards (resource advantages)

With my current resources, I can purchase exactly one development card.

## Alternative Options
- End turn and save resources
  - Risk: Robber may hit if opponent rolls 7
  - Benefit: Can potentially build a road next turn with current resources

## Decision Logic
1. Buying a development card aligns with my current plan to pursue largest army
2. Development cards provide hidden information advantage
3. Having exactly the resources for a development card is efficient
4. If I get a knight, I can move the robber from the empty desert
5. If I get a victory point card, I'm one step closer to a surprise win

<plan>
1. Buy a development card this turn to pursue largest army strategy
2. Continue focusing on ore, wheat, and sheep for more development cards
3. Build cities on my high-producing settlements when resources allow
4. Use my strong brick production to trade for needed resources
5. Still consider expanding toward the sheep port when resources permit
</plan>

Based on my analysis, I should buy a development card to align with my strategy of pursuing largest army and potentially gaining hidden victory points.

# Analysis of Current Game State

I'm playing as the BLUE player with 2 victory points, trailing RED who has 4 victory points (including 2 from longest road).

## My Current Resources:
- 3 BRICK (🧱)
- 1 Development Card (KNIGHT)
- 0 other resources

## Production Analysis:
My settlements produce:
- Settlement at node 4: 🌾8, 🧱8, 🌲2
- Settlement at node 14: 🧱8, 🐑11, ⛏️10

I have strong brick production (both settlements on 8) but am currently lacking ore, wheat, and sheep. The robber is currently on a desert hex (2, -2, 0), so it's not blocking any production.

## Evaluating My Options:

**Option 0: Play Knight card**
- Advantages:
  - I can move the robber to block RED's best hex (perhaps the 8 wheat/6 wood hex)
  - I'd steal a card from RED (who has 5 cards)
  - This would be my first knight played, moving me toward largest army
  - Playing cards before rolling protects against having to discard if a 7 is rolled
- Disadvantages:
  - I might want to save the knight for when a robber is blocking my own production

**Option 1: Roll the dice**
- Advantages:
  - Could gain resources to make progress toward my plan
  - No immediate threat of a 7 causing me to discard (I only have 3 cards)
- Disadvantages:
  - If I roll a 7, I'd need to move the robber without getting the knight benefit
  - RED might get more resources to extend their lead

## Strategic Considerations:
- RED is leading with 4 points and potentially has resources for more builds
- I currently can't build anything with just 3 brick
- My best path to victory still involves development cards for largest army and hidden VPs
- Playing the knight now could slow RED and help me get a resource I need

<plan>
1. Play the knight card to block RED's best production and steal a resource
2. Continue focusing on development cards to pursue largest army
3. Build my next settlement toward the sheep port when resources allow
4. Upgrade settlements to cities when I accumulate ore and wheat
5. Use brick production to trade for needed resources
</plan>

I've decided that playing the knight now is the optimal move. It will potentially disrupt RED's momentum while giving me a resource I need and starting my progress toward largest army.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Analyzing the Robber Placement Decision

I need to analyze where to move the robber to maximize my strategic advantage. This is a critical decision that can impact resource production and potentially disrupt my opponent's plans.

## Game State Analysis
- I (BLUE) have 2 VP (2 settlements) and need to reach 10 VP to win
- RED has 4 VP (2 settlements + longest road bonus) and is ahead
- I'm playing a knight card, which will move me toward largest army (2 VP)
- I have 3 brick resources, which is not immediately useful for my dev card strategy
- RED has 5 hidden resources, and I want to steal something useful

## RED's Production Analysis
RED has strong production at:
- Node 0: Wheat(8★★★), Wood(6★★★), Sheep(9★★)
- Node 17: Wood(2), Ore(10★), Brick(6★★★)

The most valuable hex to block would be one with high probability and that produces resources I need (ore, wheat, sheep for development cards).

## Robber Placement Options

The most strategic options are:
- [0] Move to (0,0,0): Block wheat(8★★★) and steal from RED
  - This blocks a valuable hex that RED is using for wheat production
  - Wheat is critical for dev cards and cities
  
- [5] Move to (0,1,-1): Block wood(6★★★) and steal from RED
  - This blocks wood production that RED heavily uses

- [6] Move to (1,0,-1): Block sheep(9★★) and steal from RED
  - Blocks sheep which I need for dev cards and RED uses at node 0

Considering my development card strategy and the need to disrupt RED while securing resources I need, I should prioritize hexes that produce wheat, ore, or sheep.

<plan>
1. Continue focusing on development cards to pursue largest army
2. Block RED's best wheat production to slow their expansion
3. Use brick to trade for wheat/sheep/ore when needed
4. Build settlements toward sheep port when resources allow
5. Upgrade to cities when ore and wheat are accumulated
</plan>

Option [0] is optimal as it blocks the wheat(8) hex which:
1. Is a high-probability number (8)
2. Disrupts RED's best resource production 
3. Blocks a resource I need for my development card strategy
4. Allows me to potentially steal a useful resource from RED

Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I need to analyze the game state thoroughly and determine the optimal move.

## Current Game State Assessment:
- I'm BLUE player with 2 victory points from settlements
- I have 1 🌲WOOD, 3 🧱BRICK, 1 🌾WHEAT resources
- I've played 1 knight card already
- RED has 4 VP with longest road bonus
- The robber is on the 8-value wheat hex (0,0,0), blocking a key resource
- This is mid-game (Turn 13)

## Resource Production Analysis:
- My settlements produce: 
  * Node 4: 🌾8 (high-value), 🧱8 (high-value), 🌲2 (low)
  * Node 14: 🧱8 (high-value), 🐑11 (low), ⛏️10 (moderate)
- I'm strong in brick (🧱8 x2), moderate in wheat (🌾8) and ore (⛏️10), weak in wood (🌲2) and sheep (🐑11)
- The robber is blocking my wheat production which is a critical resource for development cards and cities

## Path to Victory Analysis:
- My current plan focuses on development cards for largest army
- Based on my resources, I have enough to build one road (1 wood, 1 brick)
- Building a road would leave me with 2 brick resources
- The sheep port at nodes {35, 36} is a valuable target since sheep is one of my weaker resources
- I should position myself for settlement expansion or city upgrades when resources allow

## Road Building Options:
- Option 7 (14, 15): Expands toward the wheat port and potential new settlement locations
- Option 8 (36, 37): Moves toward the sheep port which aligns with my stated plan
- Option 4 (4, 15): Connects my two settlement networks but doesn't open immediate expansion
- Other options are less strategic for expansion

## Strategic Decision:
Looking at my current position and resources, I need to expand toward valuable locations. Road (36, 37) moves me toward the sheep port which is in my current plan and gives me better trading options for sheep when I need them for development cards.

<plan>
1. Continue focusing on development cards for largest army
2. Expand toward sheep port (nodes 35-36) for better resource management
3. Aim to move the robber off my wheat production when possible
4. Save resources for a settlement at node 36 once I reach it
5. Position for city upgrades once I have better ore/wheat production
</plan>

The most strategic road to build is toward the sheep port via edge (36, 37), which is action 8.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis and Decision Making

Let me carefully analyze the current game state before making a decision:

## Current Situation Assessment
- I have 2 VP from my 2 settlements
- I have 4 brick and 1 wheat in hand
- The robber is on the wheat hex (0,0,0), which likely affects my wheat production at node 4
- I have already played 1 knight card
- I'm building toward the sheep port at nodes 35-36
- Red has 4 VP including 2 VP from longest road

## Resource Production
My settlements produce:
- Settlement at node 4: wheat(8), brick(8), wood(2) - wheat currently blocked by robber
- Settlement at node 14: brick(8), sheep(11), ore(10)

Good brick production but wheat is currently blocked.

## Options Analysis
1. End turn [0] - No immediate benefit except waiting to collect more resources
2-4. Trading 4 brick for another resource [1-4] - Very inefficient 4:1 ratio

Looking at my current resources (4 brick, 1 wheat), I can't build anything significant:
- City requires 3 ore + 2 wheat (don't have)
- Settlement requires 1 brick + 1 wood + 1 wheat + 1 sheep (missing wood and sheep)
- Development card requires 1 ore + 1 wheat + 1 sheep (missing ore and sheep)
- Roads require 1 brick + 1 wood each (have brick but no wood)

## Strategic Considerations
1. I have excess brick (4) that I cannot effectively use right now
2. I need to diversify my resource production
3. Trading at 4:1 is inefficient but may allow progress

The best use for my brick would be to trade for wood to build roads toward the sheep port as per my plan. However, I need to calculate if this is more efficient than simply waiting for better trades.

## Decision
Since I can't build anything useful with my current resources and the 4:1 trade is highly inefficient, the best move is to end my turn and wait for better resource combinations. This also prevents me from depleting my brick which I'll need for roads toward my planned expansion.

<plan>
1. Continue focusing on development cards for largest army when resources allow
2. Expand toward sheep port (nodes 35-36) for better resource management 
3. Hope the robber moves off my wheat production soon
4. Save resources for road building and eventual settlement at node 36
5. Position for development card purchases once I have better ore production
</plan>

❓ Select action by number (0-4):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state and my options step-by-step to determine the optimal move:

**Current State Assessment:**
- I have 2 VP (from 2 settlements)
- Resources: 6 🧱BRICK, 1 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE
- The robber is on the wheat hex (0,0,0), blocking what would be my best wheat production
- RED has 4 VP (2 settlements + longest road) and 6 hidden cards

**Resource Analysis:**
- I have an abundance of brick (6) but limited wheat and ore
- My plan involves expanding toward the sheep port at nodes 35-36
- Development cards require wheat, ore, and sheep (none of which I have in abundance)
- The robber is blocking my wheat production, impacting my resource diversity

**Available Options:**
0. End Turn - Keep all resources and wait
1-4. Trade brick for other resources using the standard 4:1 port rate

**Strategic Considerations:**
- I need more diversified resources to execute my plan
- With 6 brick, I can trade some while maintaining enough for future roads
- My settlements produce brick well (two 8s), so I can afford to trade some brick
- I already have 1 ore, so getting another through trade could position me for a development card if I can acquire sheep

**Decision Analysis:**
Trading 4 brick for 1 ore through option [3] would give me 2 ore total. Combined with my 1 wheat, I would only need 1 sheep to purchase a development card, furthering my goal of potentially pursuing largest army.

My original plan focuses on development cards and expanding toward the sheep port, which I still want to pursue. However, I need to adapt to the current resource situation with the robber blocking my wheat.

<plan>
1. Trade for ore to position for development card purchase 
2. Continue aiming to expand toward sheep port (nodes 35-36) for better resource management
3. Focus on getting a development card next turn if possible (need 1 sheep)
4. Save remaining brick for road building to node 36
5. Hope the robber moves off my wheat production soon
</plan>

After analyzing the options, trading 4 brick for 1 ore best advances my strategy by positioning me for a development card purchase once I can acquire sheep.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

RESPONSE:
# Game Analysis: Robber Placement Decision

I need to decide where to place the robber to maximize my strategic advantage.

## Current Game State Analysis:
- RED has 5 VP with 3 settlements and longest road
- BLUE (me) has 2 VP with 2 settlements
- I have 1 brick, 1 wheat, and 2 ore
- Robber is currently on (-1, 0, 1) - a brick hex with value 8 that's one of my production spots

## Strategic Priorities:
1. Block RED's best production to slow their progress
2. Free my own high-value production if blocked
3. Position myself to steal useful resources
4. Protect my path to expansion

## Resource Production Analysis:
RED's settlements produce:
- Settlement at 0: wheat(8★★★), wood(6★★★), sheep(9★★)
- Settlement at 17: wood(2), ore(10★), brick(6★★★)
- Settlement at 19: wood(6★★★), wheat(5★★), wood(4★)

RED's best hex is clearly (0,0,0) with wheat 8 - this is a triple star production that powers their development.

## Robber Placement Options:
Looking at option [0]: Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED
- Blocks RED's best resource (wheat 8★★★)
- Lets me steal a card from RED
- Frees my own brick 8★★★ resource
- This hex produces for both RED and me, but affects RED more significantly

This is clearly the optimal move as it:
1. Blocks RED's best production
2. Frees my own brick production
3. Gives me a chance to steal a useful resource

<plan>
1. Place robber on wheat hex (0,0,0) to block RED's best production and free my brick
2. Use brick production to build toward sheep port (nodes 35-36)
3. Target development card purchase next (need 1 sheep)
4. Continue working toward getting cities (need more ore/wheat)
5. Consider expansion to node 36 when possible to access sheep port
</plan>

# Game Analysis for Turn 25

Let me analyze the current game state, my resources, and the available options to make the optimal strategic choice.

## Game State Assessment:
- I have 2 VP (2 settlements)
- RED has 5 VP (3 settlements + longest road bonus)
- Robber is blocking the wheat hex (0,0,0), which is hurting RED's best production
- My resources: 1 BRICK, 1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 2 ORE
- Available actions: End turn or Buy a development card

## Resource Evaluation:
I have exactly the resources needed for a development card (1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE).

## Strategic Considerations:

1. **Development Card Benefits**:
   - Could be a Victory Point card (hidden +1 VP)
   - Could be a Knight (helps move robber, builds toward Largest Army bonus)
   - Could be Year of Plenty or Monopoly (powerful resource acquisition)
   
2. **Current Plan Evaluation**:
   - My current plan mentions targeting a development card purchase (need 1 sheep)
   - I already have the sheep - this aligns perfectly with my plan
   - Building toward the sheep port is also in my plan, but requires keeping the brick

3. **RED Player Analysis**:
   - RED has 5 VP and is halfway to winning
   - They have longest road (2 VP) and 3 settlements
   - RED likely has a stronger position for immediate expansion
   
4. **Development Card vs. Saving Resources**:
   - If I end my turn, I keep my resources for potential road building
   - But I risk losing resources to a 7 roll or knight play
   - Development cards are hidden and provide strategic flexibility

## Decision Logic:

Given my current strategy with development cards as a primary path to victory, purchasing a development card is the optimal choice:

1. It directly aligns with my plan focused on development cards
2. RED is ahead with 5 VP, so I need to pursue hidden victory points
3. The card could be an immediate VP or help obtain largest army (2 VP)
4. It protects resources from being lost to a 7 roll or knight play
5. Development cards offer better VP-to-resource ratio long-term than roads

<plan>
1. Purchase development card now
2. Focus on ore/wheat production to build cities
3. If knight card received, use it to move robber from wheat hex
4. Continue working toward sheep port expansion when more brick is available
5. Aim for Largest Army bonus (need 2 more knights)
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

❓ Select action by number (0-15):


Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze the current game state and available options to determine the best move.

**Current Game State Analysis:**
- I have 2 VP from 2 settlements
- I have 1 brick, 1 ore, and a Year of Plenty card
- The robber is on the wheat hex (0,0,0), blocking my wheat production at node 4
- Red is ahead with 5 VP (3 settlements + longest road)

**Resource Analysis:**
- My settlements produce brick, wood, ore, and sheep
- I'm lacking wheat production since the robber is on my wheat hex
- I'll need ore + wheat to upgrade settlements to cities or buy development cards

**Available Actions:**
- Roll dice (option 15)
- Play Year of Plenty card to take various resource combinations (options 0-14)

**Strategic Considerations:**
1. My current plan focuses on buying development cards and upgrading to cities
2. For a city upgrade, I need 3 ore + 2 wheat (I have 1 ore)
3. For a development card, I need 1 ore + 1 wheat + 1 sheep (I have 1 ore)
4. The robber is blocking my wheat production, which is critical for both strategies

<plan>
1. Use Year of Plenty to get wheat and ore
2. Focus on upgrading settlements to cities (need more ore/wheat)
3. If knight card received from future development card purchase, move robber from wheat hex
4. Continue building toward sheep port for future development card purchases
5. Pursue Largest Army bonus (need 2 more knights)
</plan>

**Decision:**
Since I need wheat that's currently blocked by the robber, and more ore for city upgrades or development cards, I should use my Year of Plenty card to gain these critical resources.

Option 12 gives me wheat + ore, which are exactly what I need to pursue my strategy. This would give me 2 ore + 1 wheat, meaning I'd only need 1 more ore + 1 more wheat to build a city, or I could immediately buy a development card if I get a sheep in my next roll.

# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to strategically place the robber to:
1. Block high-value resources for RED (the leading player with 6 VP)
2. Potentially steal a useful resource card
3. Disrupt RED's strategy while advancing my own

## Analyzing RED's Production
RED has settlements at:
- Node 0: 🌾8(⭐⭐⭐), 🌲6(⭐⭐⭐), 🐑9(⭐⭐)
- Node 17: 🌲2, ⛏️10(⭐), 🧱6(⭐⭐⭐)
- Node 19: 🌲6(⭐⭐⭐), 🌾5(⭐⭐), 🌲4(⭐)
- Node 2: 🌾8(⭐⭐⭐), ⛏️12, 🌾9(⭐⭐)

RED is producing a lot of wheat and wood. The highest value nodes are:
- 🌾8 (hex 0,0,0): Wheat - 3 stars and connected to 2 RED settlements
- 🌲6 (hex 0,1,-1): Wood - 3 stars and connected to 2 RED settlements

## My Current Resources and Needs
I have: 3 🧱BRICK, 3 🌾WHEAT, 1 ⛏️ORE
According to my plan, I want to focus on city upgrades (need ore/wheat) and building toward the sheep port.

## Best Robber Placement Options

1. Option [0] - Move robber to (0,0,0) and steal from RED
   - This blocks the 8-wheat hex which connects to multiple RED settlements
   - RED likely has wheat since it's a high-production resource for them
   - This matches my plan of needing wheat for development cards and cities

2. Option [4] - Move robber to (0,1,-1) and steal from RED
   - This blocks the 6-wood hex which connects to 2 RED settlements
   - Wood is valuable to RED for continuing road building
   - However, wood is less important for my city-focused strategy

3. Option [11] - Move robber to (-2,1,1) and steal from RED
   - This blocks a 10-ore hex, which could slow RED's potential city upgrades
   - Ore is valuable for me but RED's production on this hex is lower (1 star)

## Decision
Option [0] is the optimal move because:
1. It blocks RED's most productive wheat hex (connected to 2 settlements)
2. Wheat is valuable both for RED and for my city upgrade strategy
3. RED likely has wheat cards I could steal
4. This directly disrupts their ability to build while potentially giving me a resource I need

<plan>
1. Move robber to wheat hex (0,0,0) to block RED's major wheat production
2. Continue focusing on upgrading settlements to cities (need more ore/wheat)
3. Build toward sheep port for efficient development card purchases
4. Buy development cards when possible for knights (to get Largest Army) and victory points
5. Consider using ports to efficiently trade for ore/wheat to build cities
</plan>

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Game Analysis

Let me thoroughly evaluate the game state and available actions to determine the best course of action.

## Current Game Status
- I have 2 VP from my 2 settlements
- RED has 6 VP (4 from settlements + 2 from Longest Road)
- I've played 1 knight already - 2 more for Largest Army
- Resources: 3 BRICK, 1 SHEEP, 3 WHEAT, 1 ORE

## Action Options
1. Buy a development card (costs: 1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE)
2. End turn (option 0)

## Strategic Considerations

Since development cards are our primary victory path, let me analyze purchasing one:

**Benefits of buying a development card:**
1. Potential Victory Point card (immediate hidden point)
2. Potential Knight card (helps toward Largest Army = 2 VP)
3. Potential Road Building/Year of Plenty/Monopoly (utility)
4. Keeps resources under 7 before next dice roll

**Current dev card distribution (with 23 remaining):**
- 5 Victory Point cards
- 14 Knight cards
- 2 Road Building cards
- 2 Year of Plenty cards
- 2 Monopoly cards

**Resource evaluation:**
- I'd use my only sheep, 1/3 of my wheat, and my only ore
- After purchase: 3 BRICK, 0 SHEEP, 2 WHEAT, 0 ORE
- Still have resources for future building

Looking at my long-term strategy:
- I've played 1 knight already, getting more knights helps toward Largest Army (2 VP)
- I need to catch up to RED who has 6 VP
- Development cards provide a hidden path to victory
- The robber is currently on wheat (0,0,0), blocking my own wheat production at node 4
- If I don't buy a card, I'll have 8 resources, risking loss on a 7 roll

<plan>
1. Buy development cards for knights (to get Largest Army) and victory points
2. Move robber off my wheat hex when I get a knight 
3. Focus on upgrading settlements to cities when I collect more ore
4. Expand toward sheep port for efficient development card purchases
5. Use brick reserves strategically for road building
</plan>

Given my strategic plan and current game state, buying a development card is the optimal choice. This maintains my development card strategy, keeps my resource count safe, and advances my path toward victory through potential knights or VP cards.

# Game Analysis and Decision Making

## Current Game Position
- I have 2 VP from my 2 settlements
- Red has 6 VP (4 settlements + longest road bonus)
- I have 3 brick, 2 wheat, and 1 Year of Plenty development card
- The robber is on my wheat hex (0, 0, 0), blocking a critical resource
- I've already played 1 knight card previously

## Resource Analysis
My current production is limited:
- Settlement at node 4: 🌾8(blocked), 🧱8, 🌲2 
- Settlement at node 14: 🧱8, 🐑11, ⛏️10

I'm currently generating good brick, but missing ore, more wheat, and sheep.

## Current Plan Evaluation
My plan to focus on development cards and cities is sound, but:
1. The robber on my wheat hex is hurting my production
2. I need ore to buy development cards and build cities
3. I need specific resources to continue my strategy

## Decision Analysis

Looking at my options:
1. Play Year of Plenty to get specific resources
2. Roll the dice

If I roll the dice:
- There's a chance the robber moves off my wheat hex
- But I could also roll a 7 and need to discard
- I'll still lack key resources like ore

Using Year of Plenty lets me select exactly what I need:
- Option [0] - Get two ore: This would allow me to buy a development card when combined with a sheep and wheat
- Option [12] - Get wheat and ore: This would give me balanced resources for development card or expansion

Since development cards are my primary path to victory, and I have no ore currently, getting two ore would be most valuable. This will allow me to purchase a development card once I acquire a sheep (through trading or future rolls).

<plan>
1. Use Year of Plenty for two ore
2. Aim to acquire sheep (through trades or rolls) to buy a development card
3. Save knight cards to move robber off my wheat hex
4. Focus on upgrading settlements to cities once I have sufficient ore/wheat
5. Continue building toward sheep port for more efficient development card purchases
</plan>

I'll choose to play Year of Plenty to get two ore, maximizing my chances of buying a development card on my next turn.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

RESPONSE:
# Game Analysis: Robber Placement Decision

I need to decide where to place the robber to maximize my strategic position while hampering my opponent, RED, who is already at 6 VP and has the longest road.

## Current Game State Assessment
- RED has 6 VP (4 settlements + 2 VP for longest road)
- I (BLUE) have 2 VP (2 settlements)
- RED is 4 VP ahead of me and much closer to winning
- The robber is currently on hex (0,0,0) which is a wheat hex with value 8 - this is blocking high-value wheat production for both myself and RED

## Strategic Considerations
1. I need to target RED's strongest resource production
2. I want to unblock valuable resources that benefit me more than RED
3. I should steal a card that helps my immediate plans
4. I need to protect my limited resource income

## Opponent Analysis
RED has strong wheat production with:
- Node 0: wheat 8 (⭐⭐⭐)
- Node 2: wheat 8 (⭐⭐⭐) and wheat 9 (⭐⭐)
- Node 19: wheat 5 (⭐⭐)

RED also has good wood production:
- Node 0: wood 6 (⭐⭐⭐)
- Node 19: wood 6 (⭐⭐⭐) and wood 4 (⭐)

## My Resource Needs
Based on my plan, I need:
- Sheep for development cards
- Ore and wheat for cities

## Robber Placement Options Analysis
The best options are:

[0] Move robber to (1, -1, 0) (Ore 12) and steal from RED
- Blocks RED's ore production at node 2
- Very low probability hex (12) with minimal impact
- Doesn't significantly harm RED's strong production

[1] Move robber to (0, -1, 1) (Wheat 9) and steal from RED
- Blocks RED's wheat 9 production at node 2
- Good probability number (9)
- Would limit RED's strong wheat production

[4] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) (Wood 6) and steal from RED
- Blocks RED's wood 6 production at nodes 0 and 19
- High probability number (6)
- Would significantly hamper RED's wood production

[5] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) (Sheep 9) and steal from RED
- Blocks RED's sheep 9 production at node 0
- Good probability number (9)
- Would limit RED's sheep production
- I need sheep for development cards

## Decision
Option [4] (Wood 6 hex) is optimal because:
1. It blocks a high-probability resource (wood 6) that RED is heavily dependent on (two settlements)
2. It impacts RED's ability to expand through roads and settlements
3. Wood 6 is one of RED's strongest production hexes
4. Moving the robber off wheat 8 unblocks my own wheat production
5. I can steal from RED, potentially getting a resource I need

<plan>
1. Place robber on RED's wood 6 hex to slow their expansion
2. Focus on acquiring sheep to buy development cards
3. Target upgrading a settlement to a city once I get more ore and wheat
4. Continue building toward sheep port for more efficient development card purchases
5. Aggressively pursue largest army bonus
</plan>

- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 39 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Place robber on RED's wood 6 hex to slow their expansion
2. Focus on acquiring sheep to buy development cards
3. Target upgrading a settlement to a city once I get more ore and wheat
4. Continue building toward sheep port for more efficient development card purchases
5. Aggressively pursue largest army bonus

Based on this information, which action number do you choose? Think step by step about your options, then put the final action number in a box like \boxed{1}.
RESPONSE:
I'll analyze this game position and determine the optimal move.

## Game State Analysis

**My Current Position:**
- 2 Victory Points (2 settlements)
- Resources: 3 🧱BRICK, 2 🌾WHEAT, 3 ⛏️ORE
- Played Cards: 1 Knight, 2 Year of Plenty
- Need 8 more points to win

**Opponent's Position:**
- RED has 6 Victory Points (4 settlements + longest road)
- RED is 4 points away from winning
- RED appears to be pursuing a road-building strategy

**Resource Production Analysis:**
- My settlements produce: 🌾8 (high), 🧱8 (high), ⛏️10, 🐑11, 🌲2
- I have strong wheat and brick production, moderate ore, weak sheep, and poor wood

**Available Actions:**
- End turn
- Build a city at node 4 (costs 2 wheat + 3 ore)
- Build a city at node 14 (costs 2 wheat + 3 ore)

## Decision Analysis

Both city upgrades would cost all my wheat and ore resources (2 wheat + 3 ore). Either upgrade would give me +1 VP (bringing me to 3/10).

**City at Node 4:**
- Produces: 🌾8 (high), 🧱8 (high), 🌲2 (low)
- Doubling production at a hex with 8 (high probability) is very valuable
- Would double my wheat production which is critical for development cards and cities

**City at Node 14:**
- Produces: 🧱8 (high), 🐑11 (low prob), ⛏️10 (low-mid prob)
- Would double brick production, which isn't as critical for my development card strategy

Looking at my original plan:
1. Place robber on RED's wood 6 hex to slow their expansion
2. Focus on acquiring sheep to buy development cards
3. Target upgrading a settlement to a city once I get more ore and wheat
4. Continue building toward sheep port for more efficient development card purchases
5. Aggressively pursue largest army bonus

This city upgrade aligns with step 3 of my plan. Since I have exactly the resources needed, and RED is at 6 points (advancing quickly with their road strategy), I should take this opportunity to get to 3 points.

## Strategy Adjustment

<plan>
1. Upgrade node 4 to a city to improve wheat production (critical for development cards)
2. Continue focusing on sheep acquisition for development cards
3. Build toward the sheep port (nodes 35-36) to enable more efficient dev card purchases
4. Pursue largest army (need 2 more knights)
5. Track RED's progress and place robber on their high-production hexes when possible
</plan>

Node 4 is clearly the better upgrade since it doubles production on a critical hex (8 wheat). Wheat is essential for both cities AND development cards, supporting my primary win path of acquiring more cities and pursuing largest army.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic

# Analysis of Robber Placement Options

I need to analyze the optimal place to move the robber based on the current game state and my strategic plan.

## Game State Assessment
- I'm at 3 VP (1 settlement, 1 city, 1 played knight) vs RED's 7 VP (5 settlements + longest road)
- RED is clearly ahead and approaching victory
- I need to maximize my development card strategy while slowing RED down

## Robber Placement Goals
1. Disrupt RED's most productive hexes
2. Target resources RED likely needs for further expansion
3. Steal a potentially valuable resource card
4. Don't block resources I critically need myself

## Analysis of Key Options

Let me examine RED's settlements and their production:
- Node 0: 🌾8[⭐⭐⭐], 🌲6[⭐⭐⭐], 🐑9[⭐⭐] - Very high production
- Node 17: 🌲2, ⛏️10[⭐], 🧱6[⭐⭐⭐] - Good brick production
- Node 19: 🌲6[⭐⭐⭐], 🌾5[⭐⭐], 🌲4[⭐] - Good wood production
- Node 2: 🌾8[⭐⭐⭐], ⛏️12, 🌾9[⭐⭐] - High wheat production
- Node 6: ⛏️12, 🐑9[⭐⭐], 🐑5[⭐⭐] - Good sheep production

Looking at the options that target high-value hexes for RED:
- [0] Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED - This blocks the 8 wheat hex connected to RED's settlements at nodes 0 and 2
- [5] Move robber to (0, 1, -1) and steal from RED - This blocks the 6 wood hex connected to nodes 0 and 19
- [6] Move robber to (1, 0, -1) and steal from RED - This blocks the 9 sheep hex connected to nodes 0 and 6

The wheat hex at (0, 0, 0) is especially powerful because:
1. It has a high production value (8)
2. It supplies two different RED settlements
3. RED might need wheat to build development cards or cities
4. It doesn't hurt my production since my wheat comes from my city at node 4

<plan>
1. Target RED's high wheat production to slow their development card purchasing
2. Focus on upgrading node 14 to a city next to improve overall production
3. Build toward sheep port (nodes 35-36) for more efficient dev card purchases
4. Continue pursuing largest army (need 2 more knights)
5. Consider blocking RED's expansion paths with strategic settlement placement
</plan>

I'll choose to block the 8 wheat hex at (0, 0, 0) which affects RED's settlements at nodes 0 and 2 - this is one of RED's most productive resources and essential for development cards.

- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 49 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Target RED's high wheat production to slow their development card purchasing
2. Focus on upgrading node 14 to a city next to improve overall production
3. Build toward sheep port (nodes 35-36) for more efficient dev card purchases
4. Continue pursuing largest army (need 2 more knights)
5. Consider blocking RED's expansion paths with strategic settlement placement
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis

Let me carefully analyze the current game state and available options:

## Current Resources
- I have: 3 🧱BRICK, 2 🐑SHEEP, 4 ⛏️ORE
- I'm missing 🌲WOOD and 🌾WHEAT completely

## Victory Point Assessment
- I have 3 VP (1 settlement + 1 city + 1 knight)
- RED has 7 VP (5 settlements + 2 VP for longest road)
- RED is much closer to victory and needs to be slowed down

## Available Actions
- [0] End turn
- [1-4] Maritime trades at unfavorable 4:1 ratios

## Development Card Strategy
Looking at my plan, I want to:
1. Upgrade node 14 to a city (need 3 ORE + 2 WHEAT)
2. Build toward sheep port
3. Continue pursuing largest army

## Assessment of Trading Options
- For upgrading node 14, I need WHEAT but lack it completely
- I'm building toward the sheep port, but I need WOOD to build roads
- Trading at 4:1 is very inefficient, but I have excess ORE (4) that I could trade

## Strategic Decision
Since I can't directly pursue the city upgrade without WHEAT, and my road network won't expand without WOOD, I need to decide whether to:
1. Trade for a resource I need now
2. End my turn and wait for better dice rolls

Given the game state, if I trade now at the 4:1 rate, I'll deplete my ORE reserves which would be inefficient. Since I have 3 BRICK and 2 SHEEP already, I can potentially build a road and then a settlement when I get WOOD, or work toward a city when I get WHEAT.

<plan>
1. Hold resources this turn as 4:1 trades are too inefficient
2. Focus on acquiring WOOD or WHEAT through dice rolls to proceed with either:
   - Building roads toward sheep port (needs WOOD)
   - Upgrading node 14 to a city (needs WHEAT)
3. Continue development card strategy when resources allow
4. Monitor RED's expansion and be ready to block when opportunity arises
</plan>

Given the unfavorable trading options and my current resource position, the most strategic move is to end my turn and wait for more favorable dice rolls to give me the resources I need.

# Game Analysis for Settlers of Catan

Let me analyze the current game state and available options:

## Current Position Assessment
- I have 3 VP (1 settlement + 1 city + 1 knight played)
- Resources: 3 BRICK, 2 SHEEP, 4 ORE
- RED has 7 VP (5 settlements + 2 VP from longest road)
- RED is ahead by 4 VP and has 9 hidden resource cards
- The robber is on the wheat hex (0,0,0), blocking a productive hex that would benefit both RED and me

## Available Actions
My only options are:
- End turn
- Make 4:1 maritime trades (converting 4 ORE to get 1 of another resource)

## Strategic Considerations

1. **Current Plan Review**
   - My plan involves holding resources due to inefficient 4:1 trades
   - I want to focus on acquiring WOOD or WHEAT
   - I need WOOD to build roads toward the sheep port
   - I need WHEAT to upgrade node 14 to a city

2. **Resource Analysis**
   - I have 4 ORE, which is potentially useful for city upgrades or development cards
   - I'm missing WOOD and WHEAT, which are critical for my plan
   - A 4:1 trade is inefficient, but might be necessary if it enables a strategic move

3. **Decision Factors**
   - No development card purchase is possible (need WHEAT)
   - No building is possible with current resources
   - RED is 3 VP ahead and has 9 resources, indicating they may be close to making moves
   - The robber is on a wheat hex, which affects both players

4. **Option Evaluation**
   - Option 0 (End Turn): Conserves resources but makes no progress
   - Option 1 (Trade for WOOD): Would give me 1 WOOD, but not enough to build a road (need 1 WOOD + 1 BRICK)
   - Option 3 (Trade for WHEAT): Would give me 1 WHEAT, but I'd still need 1 more WHEAT for a city upgrade

Given my current resources and the inefficiency of 4:1 trades, the best option is to end my turn and wait for better opportunities. Trading away my ORE leaves me with fewer options on future turns, particularly for city upgrades or development cards, which are central to my strategy.

<plan>
1. Maintain current resources this turn
2. Focus on acquiring natural WOOD or WHEAT through dice rolls
3. Once I have WHEAT: prioritize city upgrade at node 14 (gives +1 VP and boosts production)
4. Monitor RED's expansion and be prepared to block when opportunity arises
5. Consider development card purchases when I have the right resources

- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 57 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Maintain current resources this turn
2. Focus on acquiring natural WOOD or WHEAT through dice rolls
3. Once I have WHEAT: prioritize city upgrade at node 14 (gives +1 VP and boosts production)
4. Monitor RED's expansion and be prepared to block when opportunity arises
5. Consider development card purchases when I have the right resources
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis - Turn 57

Let me analyze the current game state to make the best decision.

## Current Position Assessment
- I have 3/10 victory points (1 from settlement, 2 from city)
- RED is ahead with 8/10 points (4 settlements, 1 city, 2 from longest road)
- RED has 8 hidden resource cards, which is concerning
- I have 7 resources: 2 BRICK, 1 SHEEP, 2 WHEAT, 2 ORE

## Resource Analysis
- Good balance of resources, but limited SHEEP (only 1 card)
- I have exactly what I need to buy a development card (1 SHEEP, 1 WHEAT, 1 ORE)

## Strategic Considerations
1. RED is very close to winning with 8 VP already
2. I'm far behind at 3 VP, but development cards could provide hidden victory points
3. Since the robber is on my BRICK hex, I should use those bricks before I lose more
4. My existing plan prioritizes city upgrade at node 14, but I'm missing the WOOD for that
5. Buying a dev card could give me:
   - Knight (to move robber and start building toward largest army)
   - Victory point (hidden, bringing me to 4/10)
   - Year of Plenty (already played 2, would help get resources I need)
   - Monopoly (could be powerful if RED has resources I need)
   - Road Building (could help expansion)

## Decision Logic
Since RED is so close to winning (8/10 VP), I need to prioritize actions that might slow them down or accelerate my own progress. Development cards are the most efficient way to potentially gain victory points and tactical advantages.

If I end my turn (action 0), I'll maintain my current resources but won't make progress toward winning. RED will get their turn and might reach 10 VP soon.

If I buy a development card (action 1), I:
- Use resources efficiently before potential robber losses
- Might get a hidden victory point
- Could get a knight to move the robber or start building toward largest army
- Maintain the element of surprise about my actual point total

<plan>
1. Buy a development card this turn
2. If it's a VP card, continue resource collection for city upgrade
3. If it's a knight, use it strategically to protect my production or disrupt RED
4. If it's Monopoly or Year of Plenty, save it for when I need specific resources
5. Focus next on upgrading settlement at node 14 to a city (+1 VP)
6. Consider expansion toward WOOD port (nodes 32, 33) for better resource conversion
</plan>

Given RED's proximity to winning and my need to make progress, buying a development card is clearly the optimal choice.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

# Game State Analysis

Let me carefully assess my current situation in this Settlers of Catan game:

## Victory Points Assessment
- I have 3 known VPs: 1 city (2 VP) + 1 settlement (1 VP)
- I have 1 hidden victory point card
- Total: 4 VPs

## Resource Assessment
- Current resources: 2 Brick, 1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore
- These resources allow me to buy a development card (1 Sheep, 1 Wheat, 1 Ore)
- I would have 2 Brick remaining after this purchase

## Board Position & Opponent Assessment
- RED is at 9 VPs (very close to winning)
- RED has 7 hidden resource cards
- RED has longest road (+2 VP)
- The robber is currently on a brick hex (-1,0,1) with 8 (high production)

## Strategic Considerations
1. RED is just 1 VP away from winning, making this a critical turn
2. I'm far behind (4 VP vs 9 VP) and need to focus on my development card strategy
3. Buying a development card could give me:
   - Victory Point card (immediate +1 hidden VP)
   - Knight card (can move robber to disrupt RED and work toward largest army)
   - Year of Plenty/Monopoly (utility cards for future turns)
4. I already have one hidden VP card, so another would bring me to 5 VP

## Decision Process
The choice is between:
- [0] End turn (keeping my resources)
- [1] Buy development card

Given RED's proximity to winning, I need to accelerate my VP accumulation. Development cards offer the most efficient path, especially for VP cards which provide immediate value. Even non-VP cards provide strategic options to slow RED or accelerate my progress.

Since I have the exact resources needed for a development card and this aligns with my current plan of focusing on the development card strategy, buying a development card is clearly the optimal move.

<plan>
1. Buy a development card this turn
2. If it's a VP card, continue resource collection for city upgrade at node 14
3. If it's a knight, use it to disrupt RED's production (target their 8 wheat or 6 wood hexes)
4. Save 2 brick and collect resources for settlement expansion or city upgrade
5. Target largest army (need 2 more knights) as a path to +2 VP
6. Consider expansion toward WOOD port (nodes 32, 33) with my existing brick
</plan>

- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

TURN 63 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Buy a development card this turn
2. If it's a VP card, continue resource collection for city upgrade at node 14
3. If it's a knight, use it to disrupt RED's production (target their 8 wheat or 6 wood hexes)
4. Save 2 brick and collect resources for settlement expansion or city upgrade
5. Target largest army (need 2 more knights) as a path to +2 VP
6. Consider expansion toward WOOD port (nodes 32, 33) with my existing brick
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

# Game Analysis: BLUE's Turn Decision

Let me analyze the current game state and my options:

## Current Game Status:
- RED has 9 VP (5 settlements, 1 city, longest road +2 VP)
- BLUE has 3 VP (1 settlement, 1 city) + 1 hidden VP card = 4 VP total
- I have 2 brick resources and 1 knight development card
- RED is one point away from winning

## My Options:
1. **Play Knight Card [0]**: Move the robber and steal a resource
2. **Roll the Dice [1]**: Continue normal turn sequence

## Strategic Considerations:

**Option 0 - Play Knight Card:**
- Benefits:
  - Can disrupt RED's production by targeting their strong resources (8 wheat or 6 wood)
  - Might steal a useful resource from RED
  - Moves toward largest army bonus (I would have 2 knights played)
  - Avoids risk of rolling a 7 and losing resources if RED has 7+ cards

**Option 1 - Roll the Dice:**
- Benefits:
  - Could gain more resources to build with
  - Preserves knight card for future defensive use

## Decision Logic:

RED is one point away from winning, making this an emergency situation. My previous plan included using the knight to disrupt RED's production. Since RED has 6 hidden cards, there's a high probability they're planning their winning move.

The most strategic action is to play my knight card to:
1. Disrupt RED's production on their most valuable hex (8 wheat or 6 wood)
2. Potentially steal a resource RED needs for their winning move
3. Progress toward largest army (need 3 knights)

<plan>
1. Play knight card to move robber to RED's 8 wheat or 6 wood hex
2. Target RED for stealing (they have 6 cards)
3. Continue collecting resources for city upgrade at node 14
4. Use my brick to start expanding toward wood port (nodes 32, 33)
5. Buy development cards to pursue largest army (need 1 more knight)
6. Focus on blocking RED's path to victory while building toward my own
</plan>

Since RED is dangerously close to winning with 9 VP, disrupting their production is the highest priority. I should play my knight card.

PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources

# Game Analysis: Settlers of Catan Move Robber Decision

Let me analyze the current game state and determine the best move for placing the robber:

## Current Game Situation
- RED has 9/10 victory points and 6 hidden cards - they are about to win!
- I (BLUE) have only 3/10 victory points with 2 brick resources
- RED has longest road (+2 VP) and 5 settlements (5 VP) + 1 city (2 VP) = 9 VP total
- I need to significantly disrupt RED's strategy while building toward my own victory

## Robber Placement Analysis

The key priorities for my robber placement:
1. Block RED's most productive hexes to slow them down
2. Choose a hex that RED has multiple settlements/cities on
3. Target a resource RED likely needs for their next build (to win)

Looking at RED's buildings:
- At node 0: Produces wheat(8★★★), wood(6★★★), sheep(9★★)
- At node 19: Produces wood(6★★★), wheat(5★★), wood(4★)

The wheat(8) hex at (0,0,0) stands out as extremely valuable to RED because:
- It's a high-probability number (8 = ★★★)
- RED has two buildings collecting from it (at nodes 0 and 2)
- RED's city at node 0 produces this resource
- Wheat is critical for both settlements and development cards

## Strategic Consideration
RED is at 9 VP and likely needs just one more settlement to win (or potentially has a hidden VP card). Blocking their wheat production is critical to prevent them from getting their final victory point.

<plan>
1. Move robber to the wheat(8) hex at (0,0,0) to block RED's most productive hex
2. Steal a card from RED, hoping for a useful resource
3. Use my brick to start expanding toward wood port (nodes 32, 33)
4. Buy development cards to pursue largest army (need 1 more knight)
5. Focus on upgrading settlement at node 14 to a city for additional VP
6. Continue blocking RED's resources until I can catch up in points
</plan>

Based on this analysis, I should select option 0: Move robber to (0, 0, 0) and steal from RED.

- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- 🔍 marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

# Robber Placement Analysis

I need to analyze where to place the robber to maximize my advantage against RED, who is dangerously close to winning with 9/10 victory points.

## Game State Assessment:
- RED is at 9/10 VP (including 2 VP for longest road)
- I'm at 3/10 VP (plus 1 hidden VP from my development card = 4/10)
- RED has extensive control with 5 settlements, 1 city, and longest road
- I need to significantly hinder RED's production while advancing my position

## Robber Target Analysis:
Looking at RED's most productive hexes:
1. 🌾8 at (0,0,0) - Currently has robber, produces for RED's city (node 0) and settlement (node 2)
2. 🌲6 at (0,1,-1) - Produces for RED's city (node 0) and settlement (node 19)
3. 🧱6 at (-2,2,0) - Produces for RED's settlement (node 17)
4. 🐑9 at (1,0,-1) - Produces for RED's city (node 0) and settlement (node 6)
5. 🌾9 at (0,-1,1) - Produces for RED's settlements (nodes 2 and 10)

The most damaging options are:
- Keep robber on 🌾8 (option not available)
- Move to 🌲6 hex [4] (0,1,-1) - Blocks high-probability wood for both RED's city and settlement
- Move to 🐑9 hex [5] (1,0,-1) - Blocks high-probability sheep for RED's city and settlement
- Move to 🌾9 hex [1] (0,-1,1) - Blocks wheat for two RED settlements

## Strategic Considerations:
1. RED likely needs just one more build to win
2. RED has 5 hidden cards - potentially enough for a settlement or development card
3. I should target resources RED likely needs for their final point
4. Wheat is crucial for both settlements and development cards
5. Wood is essential for settlements and roads
6. I should also consider what I might steal from RED

<plan>
1. Move robber to 🌲6 hex at (0,1,-1) to block RED's wood production from two buildings
2. Use my brick to expand toward wood port (nodes 32, 33)
3. Buy development cards to pursue largest army (need 1 more knight)
4. Focus on upgrading settlement at node 14 to a city for additional VP
5. Try to block RED's expansion while building my own VP
</plan>

After careful consideration, I should target the 🌲6 hex at (0,1,-1) with action [4]. This blocks a highly productive hex (6 is the second-best probability) that supplies two of RED's buildings, including their city. Wood is critical for RED if they want to build more roads or settlements for their final point. This also gives me a chance to steal a resource from RED.

========================================
PROMPT:
You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?

- The robber is already on the 🌲6 hex at (0,1,-1) blocking RED's wood production

## My Available Options
I can either end my turn or build a road. The road options would use 1 wood, 1 brick, leaving me with 1 brick, 1 wheat.

## Strategic Considerations

RED is one point away from winning, which makes this an extremely critical turn. I need to:
1. Impede RED's progress if possible
2. Position myself for the fastest path to victory
3. Consider my resource acquisition for next turn

Looking at the road options:
- Roads toward the wood port (32, 33) would allow for 2:1 wood trades, but the path isn't clear from the current options
- Road (37, 38) moves me toward the wheat port
- Road (35, 36) moves me toward the sheep port where I already have a road

Let me check what builds might be critical:

I need to increase my resource production and VP count. Getting largest army requires one more knight, which costs sheep/wheat/ore. My settlement at node 14 produces brick, sheep, and ore. Upgrading this to a city would give +1 VP and double my ore production.

<plan>
1. Build strategically to secure development card resources
2. Focus on getting one more knight to secure Largest Army (2 VP)
3. Aim for city upgrades (need ore/wheat) to reach 4 VP from cities/settlements + 1 VP card + 2 VP largest army = 7 VP
4. Then aim for 2-3 more settlements or VP cards
</plan>

Looking at the road options that help this plan:
- Road (37, 38) moves toward the wheat port (38, 39) which would help with city upgrades and development cards
- Road (14, 15) connects to my settlement at node 14 and moves toward the brick/ore producing areas

Immediate priority: I need to position myself to get more resources and potentially develop toward building spots or ports that complement my strategy.

Given RED is at 9 VP, I have very little time. The road (37, 38) seems most strategic as it moves me toward the wheat port, which is crucial for both development cards and city upgrades.
