Placing your initial settlements in Settlers of Catan is crucial for setting up a strong position in the game. Here are some strategies to consider when placing your settlements:
1. Resource Variety

Aim to have access to a variety of resources (brick, wood, wheat, sheep, and ore). A balanced resource base helps you build roads, settlements, and cities effectively.

2. High-Probability Numbers [...] The first player has the advantage of choosing the best spot, but the second player can often secure a complementary position. Consider the overall board layout and your opponents' strategies.

Example Strategy

First Settlement: Place on a high-probability wheat and brick tile (e.g., a 6 wheat and 5 brick).
Second Settlement: Aim for a location that gives you access to ore and sheep (e.g., a 9 ore and 4 sheep), or a good port depending on your resource needs. [...] Work with what the dice give you. Sometimes, that will be nothing.
Your strategy in Catan will be based heavily off of your initial placement of your Settlements. The serpentine placement pattern (P1, P2, P3, P4, P4, P3, P2, P1) is very good at balancing out who gets access to the best spots, but think carefully about where you‚Äôre going to start and what you‚Äôre going to work towards.

As a rule of thumb, during your first settlement placement, it‚Äôs usually best not to point your road toward the middle of the board. You will likely have no expansion spots since everyone will start toward the middle, rather than the coast.
Anytime your road is in a contestable direction, make sure you‚Äôre the one cutting someone off or are more likely to win the race ‚Äî not the other way around.

In Settlers of Catan, the order in which players place their initial settlements can significantly impact their strategy and success in the game. Each position‚Äîfirst, middle, or last‚Äîhas its advantages and disadvantages:
First Player
Advantages:- Optimal Location: The first player can choose the best starting spot on the board, often securing a high-probability resource hex (like 6s or 8s) and access to diverse resources. [...] Cities first strategy
Since cities double your earning power, an effective strategy can be to optimize for as much wheat and rock as you can get early in the game, upgrade to two cities as quickly as possible, and then trade out some of your abundant wheat and rock for wood and brick later to build roads and expand. If you can get access to sheep with this strategy, you can also quickly and easily pursue a strategy of buying a lot of development cards before building more settlements. [...] Given there is a limit of 7 cards before you are at risk of losing half your cards, it can be advantageous to have a steady stream of resources coming into your hand throughout the game. The best way to do this is to place your two first settlements on intersections with six different numbers total with ideally, the highest probability. If you can manage it, the best numbers to be on from the beginning would be 4,5,6,8,9,10 or some combination as close to that as possible. Ideally you would

Rather than attempting to collect every resource, it‚Äôs generally more effective to focus on only a few resources. The two main ways to do this are the ‚ÄúWood / Brick‚Äù strategy, and the ‚ÄúOre / Wheat‚Äù strategy. [...] Let‚Äôs start by talking about some of the overall strategies you can take in Catan. The first strategy is the ‚ÄúBalanced Approach‚Äù. In this strategy you are simply trying to diversify your resources as much as possible by placing your settlements on a wide variety of resources, with a variety of different numbers. The goal of this strategy is to ensure that you have access to every material in the game, without relying on trading with other players or the bank. This is a very basic strategy that [...] The second resource-based strategy is the ‚ÄúOre / Wheat‚Äù Strategy. This strategy focuses on building cities and buying development cards, and lends itself towards getting the largest army card. By building cities as early as possible you can increase your resource gathering, with the added bonus that your first cities will probably be on your original settlements which should be in prime locations on the board. While you can technically win with only your first two cities, the largest army, and

(As a reminder there are 3 ore, 3 brick, 4 lumber, 4 grain, 4 wool)
Typically, I will look at ore first, then grain, brick, lumber, ending with the least important one of them all ‚Äî wool.

(Keep in mind, since wool is the least desirable as it‚Äôs only used for development cards/settlements, players are usually happy to trade theirs away ‚Äî try to avoid having too much production of those pesky sheep.) [...] In theory, you should aim to have equal ‚Äúbips‚Äù of brick and lumber, as well as, 3:2 bips for ore and grain (notice ‚Äî this equates to a city). [...] Probably the single biggest shortcoming of new players is their under-appreciation of ports.
On a map that has outsized production of one or two resources, pay close attention to where those resources‚Äô respective ports are located. If someone can double or triple up on a resource while accessing the proper 2:1 port, that person can gain momentum faster than the rest of the table may realize.

This strategy focuses on development cards, building other things only as an aside when development and resource cards dictate it. They'll usually end up with the Largest Army card and the lion's share of the victory point cards, and generally make a fabulous nuisance of themselves. This is a great strategy if you have good ore/wheat/sheep balance, but is always fun to play, especially because you'll be dropping the robber all over the place but your board position will appear sufficiently weak [...] Using the robber well is crucial - on average, the robber will turn up once in every six rolls and it also gets moved when playing a knight.

- use it on the person in the strongest position (not necessarily the open points leader). Count unplayed development cards in someone's hand as points. Someone who gets Longest Road early is rarely a threat in the long term.

- use the robber exclusively on your strongest opponent. Avoid motivating more than one of your opponents to seek revenge! [...] Year of Plenty: This card is a bit of a raw deal (you've spent 3 resource cards to get 2!), but in the early game it can be handy when certain resources are hard to come by. Any hand can be built from when you can add two wildcards to it, and you can effectively hold a 9 card hand safely with it. Good for getting the first city to get you in the production lead. Less useful later, but you can always use it to help buy another development card.

Sort the resource cards into 5 stacks and place them face up beside the board.
Shuffle the development cards Y and place them face down beside the resource cards.
Place the 2 special cards and the dice beside the board.
Place the robber in the desert.
The set-up phase has 2 rounds. Each player builds 1 road and 1 settlement per round.
Round One Each player rolls both dice. The player who rolls highest is the starting player and begins. [...] Important: If the production number for the hex containing the robber is rolled, the owners of adjacent settlements and cities do not receive resources. The robber prevents it.
b) Playing Development Cards Y At any time during your turn, you may play 1 development card (put it face up on the table). That card, however, may not be a card you bought during the same turn (except for a victory point card, as described below)!

The robber Y starts the game there. A settlement or a city built adjacent to the desert yields fewer resources than those built next to one of the other terrain types.
Development Cards There are 3 different kinds of development cards: Knight Cards Y, Progress Cards Y, and Victory Point Cards Y.

Settlers of Catan ‚Äì Strategy¬†Primer



This is a primer for The Settlers of Catan that will cover the high-level strategies and specific tactics you can use to improve your play.¬† I am assuming you know the rules and will just jump into the strategy.¬† Check out the video version above or the text version below.

4 Primary Strategies:

Longest Road

Largest Army

2:1 Port

Wheat Monopoly

Longest Road [...] The idea here is to get as much ore, wheat, and sheep as possible, but an equal-ish share of each so that you can buy tons of development cards. You‚Äôll also want some brick and wood to build your first two roads and third settlement. This is the best general strategy in the game, but can be defeated by the port or wheat monopoly strategy if the board greatly favors them.¬† With this strategy, you control the game by directing the robber around the board with your soldiers and surprise everyone [...] Here you just want as much brick and wood as possible, so you can expand and build settlements.¬† This is the easiest strategy for a newbie to use, but the more I have played Catan, the less I like this one. It works great in the early game because you can expand quickly and cut off your opponents from the spots they want but the challenge is staying relevant as the game gets into the later stages. You can usually get to 7 points fairly quickly with your 5 settlements and your longest road, but

Positioning your settlements on the same side of the board (without someone else‚Äôs impenetrable presence in the way), is a great way to secure the longest road, even if you didn‚Äôt plan for it.
Many of the fastest games are won with this setup. Someone has the largest army and a minimal amount of effort connecting both of their roads is sufficient to secure the longest road to get to 10 VPs.

strategy to use is combining cities with trade on the coast so for example if you've got a city on wood and you have the wood trade every time you collect two wood that's basically a free resource of any type if you win a lot of games against the same people try switching up the color you play out people can start associating a specific player with the bad guy you being the bad guy because you keep winning and it's this little psychological game where you choose a color that's usually the [...] want attention don't be shy about calling attention to other people to kind of get that heat off yet when you're trading resources ask what your opponents want first instead of just asking what you want so for example you might say who would like some brick and then people who are interested and the resource you're trying to get rid of will offer you resources and you can oftentimes get a better feel for what's available to you when you trade with that kind of communication instead and in the [...] they're not settled on a ten they're settled on a high probability six but if you diversify the numbers that you're on it doesn't matter what's rolled you'll be picking up resources some of my best games are when I'm settled on just about every number so no matter what happens I'm collecting stuff next try not to draw too much attention to yourself if people see you're winning they're less likely to trade with you they're more likely to pick on you try to block you off robbed you so you don't

The strategies all kind of blend together in the late game when everyone has multiple cities/settlements/roads/cards, trading is mostly happening with the bank/ports for fear of letting someone else go out on their turn, battle will be fierce for the bonus cards, and development cards are disappearing at a furious rate. Don't stress over settlement positioning in the late game - put them anywhere you can, they're victory points rather than production sources. [...] Obvious leads make you a target. Longest Road in particular should be picked up as late as possible. Joining up two separate road segments with a big road-building push and unveiling 2 victory point cards can give you the win from 6 points. Largest Army on the other hand needs to be more openly competed for, because of the play-only-one-development-card-per-turn rule. Victory point cards are great to have because they create uncertainty in your opponents (is it a VP or a monopoly card?). [...] 5. You get close but no cigarPay attention to what the other players need to win. Someone about to unveil a knight or a victory point card to win the game? Build a settlement in the middle of their longest road. Don't trade with others when they're close to going out, even if it is great for you - no one remembers who came second. Someone hemmed in but otherwise strong? Compete with them for Largest Army. Someone holding the longest road about to go out? Trade wood and brick favorably with

    new_text: You are playing Settlers of Catan as an expert strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state carefully and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze recent resource changes and track your production capabilities
7. Think about your path to victory, not just the immediate action

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Prioritize high-probability hexes (6 & 8) with diverse resources
- Aim for access to all five resources between your two settlements
- Target ore and wheat for city upgrades; wood and brick for expansion
- Position near a port that matches your expected resource abundance
- Consider hex numbers to ensure you collect resources on varied dice rolls
- Place roads strategically toward expansion opportunities

RESOURCE STRATEGY:
- Prioritize ore and wheat for cities; wood and brick for roads/settlements
- Aggressively trade excess resources using ports rather than basic 4:1 trades
- Calculate resource efficiency for each potential build (VP per resource spent)
- Track opponents' resources and priorities

DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY:
- When to focus on cities: When you have reliable ore and wheat production
- When to focus on settlements: When you have reliable wood and brick production
- When to buy development cards: When you control fewer high-probability hexes
- Always upgrade settlements on your highest-producing hexes first

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Target opponents closest to winning, not just the current leader
- Place the robber on high-production hexes that don't affect you
- When playing a Knight card, time it to disrupt opponents' build plans
- Maintain knight cards for defense if holding 7+ resources

PATH TO VICTORY:
- Track your clearest path to 10 points (cities, settlements, largest army, longest road)
- Actively block opponents' expansion paths that threaten your strategy
- Build toward the longest road only when you can secure it definitively
- Use development cards strategically for timing advantages

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)================================= Tool Message =================================

I've significantly improved the prompt for promptRefiningLLM_player_C with a more strategic approach based on my analysis of the game logs and research on effective Catan strategies. Here are the key improvements I made:

1. **Enhanced Initial Placement Strategy**:
   - Added specific guidance on prioritizing high-probability hexes (6 & 8)
   - Emphasized the importance of resource diversity and specific resource targeting
   - Included port considerations during initial placement
   - Added dice probability considerations for more consistent resource collection

2. **Robust Resource Management**:
   - Provided clearer priorities for resource allocation based on strategy
   - Discouraged inefficient 4:1 trades in favor of port usage
   - Added guidance on calculating resource efficiency
   - Encouraged tracking opponent resources for better decision-making

3. **Strategic Development Path**:
   - Added conditional logic for when to pursue different build strategies
   - Provided clear guidance on city upgrade prioritization
   - Added context for when development card purchases make sense
   - Improved robber placement strategy

4. **Clear Victory Pathways**:
   - Added explicit instruction to track paths to victory
   - Included opponent blocking strategies
   - Provided better guidance on when to pursue longest road
   - Added strategic development card usage timing

5. **Overall Tactical Improvements**:
   - Made the prompt more directive with expert-level strategic insights
   - Added more specific actionable guidance rather than general principles
   - Created clearer decision frameworks for different game phases

These improvements should help the player make better initial placements, manage resources more efficiently, make strategic build decisions, and have clearer paths to victory. This should significantly improve its performance against the AlphaBetaPlayer.Evolve Counter: 9

Overall, placing your starting settlements wisely will give you a huge advantage in Settlers of Catan. But this is just one of the many strategies that can be employed in the game.

It is very hard to employ all these tactics in every game though, as the board is arranged randomly by the system and your neighbors choices restrict yours.

However, having a good grasp of starting positions and initial placements will help greatly in winning you your next Colonist game. [...] Colonist Strategies: What are the Best Catan Starting Strategies?

Today we will be giving you pointers on the best starting placement strategies for Settlers of Catan that you can use in Colonist.

Colonist.io

1. Identify Your Goals

The first and most important Catan Strategy is knowing what you want to build. This will dictate which resources you should go after when you place your starting settlements. [...] 6. Ports for High Concentration of the Same Resource

Waterfront properties are valuable. Both in real life and in Settlers of Catan.

Owning one makes the bank love you. To the point that they‚Äôll be willing to trade for less resources.

This is why ports play an important role in The Settlers of Catan.

Having the ability to trade 2:1 can win your game, so looking at the available ports on the board during your first placement is critical.

As a rule of thumb, during your first settlement placement, it‚Äôs usually best not to point your road toward the middle of the board. You will likely have no expansion spots since everyone will start toward the middle, rather than the coast.
Anytime your road is in a contestable direction, make sure you‚Äôre the one cutting someone off or are more likely to win the race ‚Äî not the other way around. [...] Think of a Catan map as having 3 areas ‚Äî the center, inner, and coastal rings. The ‚Äúcenter‚Äù is all the spots around the middle hex, ‚Äúinner‚Äù is the next one outward, and so on.
For starters, the coast never makes sense for your first placement as it will only have 2 hexes of production (3 for you to build more central) and it will inhibit your optionality to expand. [...] This is what you should spend most of your time thinking about when making your initial placements. Depending on who you are playing with and where they might place their settlements will have a major impact on your game.
You need to think about how their spots will affect your placements, how strong their set-up will be, and how it will affect their relationships with everyone else at the table. (More on this later.)

#5. Diversify your numbers.

The best way to do this is to place your two first settlements on intersections with six different numbers total with ideally, the highest probability.

The concept for the Development Card Strategy is to ignore wood and brick completely when you are placing your initial settlements. Instead, you want, in order, Ore, Wheat, and Sheep. Cities and Development Cards are your friends.  
To achieve 10 victory points, most of the time you'll want to: [...] 3rd Player. Initial placement 5 ore, 4 wheat, 8 wheat, 11 wood, 6 brick. Won. Despite my best efforts to play a Development Card strategy, the best placements for ore and wheat gave me brick and wood, so this one played more like an expansion strategy. I finished with longest road, largest army, 2 cities, 2 settlements, and 1 bonus point.
4th Player. Initial placement 4 ore, 3 wheat, 8 sheep, 5 sheep, 11 sheep. Lost. This strategy is not viable with such low quantities of ore and wheat. [...] 1st Player. Initial placement 6 ore x2, 11 ore, 5 wheat, 11 sheep, 12 wood. Lost. I struggled for resources in this one. Getting ore was dependent on a single 6, which drew the robber often, and only the single 5 gave me wheat.
3rd Player. Initial placement 4 ore, 9 ore, 6 wheat, 5 sheep, 11 sheep x2. Won. I had plenty of ore, wheat, and sheep, which led to an easy victory with largest army, 5 points for 2 cities and a settlement, longest road, and 2 bonus points.

In a small sample size deviations like these are typical. Your job is to mitigate luck as much as possible, and you can do this by playing the odds (maximizing pips and getting a good distribution of numbers) as best you can when you're placing your settlements.

Step 5: Development Cards

The development card (25) distribution is as follows:

- 14 Knights (56%)- 5 Victory Points (20%)- 2 Monopoly (8%)- 2 Road Building (8%)- 2 Year of Plenty (8%) [...] Commander: buys 6 development cards to get Largest Army and a victory point, builds 2 roads, 2 settlements and 3 cities. Developer: buys 12 development cards to get Largest Army and 2 victory points, builds 1 settlement and 3 cities.Producer: builds 6 roads, 4 settlements and 4 cities.Explorer: builds 10 roads to get Longest Road, 4 settlements, and 2 cities.Queen of Sheep: replaces all ore needs with sheep, plays Commander, buys 6 development cards to get Largest Army and a victory point, [...] - try to avoid trading down to just a few cards with the bank and being stuck unable to build. Chances are, you're doing so for a resource you're finding hard to get and therefore other players will know they can disproportionately hurt you with the robber if they steal it.

- preserve juicy settlement locations with judicious road placement. Lock up that port that's critical to your strategy early. Nothing more infuriating than having an opponent beat you to it.

Once in a while, one of the above strategies for the robber may be correct. If someone has nine victory points, and a handful of cards, putting the robber on them probably is the best idea. At the end of the game, placing the robber is pretty easy to figure out. But, what about in the beginning of the game? What about the middle? Placing the robber in the early/middle of the game will absolutely have one intended effect ‚Äì someone will not like you for putting it on them. If you‚Äôve hit someone [...] You should also make sure that you only affect one player with the robber. Affecting two players doubles the revenge factor, as well as doubles the motivation to move it with a soldier card. If only one person is affected, then the robber will probably spend longer on that spot. As a rule of thumb, in the early/middle game, you should place the robber on the player to your right. The reason is that it will spend more time there. The player to your right can‚Äôt take the robber off for two or [...] THE ROBBER:  
You‚Äôre always supposed to place the robber on the person with the most victory points, right? Or, wait, you‚Äôre supposed to place it on a 6 or 8 so that it takes out someone‚Äôs best number, correct? Or was it that you should try to put it so that it affects as many people as possible? And of course, you never want to put the robber on someone holding development cards because they probably have a soldier, and they‚Äôll just put it right back on you won‚Äôt they?

It probably goes without saying, but robber placement should hinder the biggest threat to you and in general, experienced Catan gamers will be understanding if that‚Äôs what you do.  Less forgiving is when you use it early on, hitting many people at once.  That tends to leave a bad taste in people‚Äôs mouths as they look for retribution.  Having multiple people gunning for you is not fun.  Also, if you can‚Äôt figure out who to sic the robber on, place it on the person to your right.  There‚Äôs a high [...] 3. Understand which resources are scarce:
The interesting thing in Settlers of Catan is that no matter your strategy, you‚Äôll need every resource eventually.  And if one of the resources turns out to be rare, expect competition to be fierce! Use those rare resources to your advantage by trading aggressively and cutting deals that would be borderline highway robbery.

As a result, you will start with a road which gives you a great first mover advantage if you are in a race with anyone. This can help you secure a contested spot with your first settlement or deliberately cut someone off placing two roads from your second placement.
#13. Consider which spots will always be knighted.

In a development card heavy game (lots of ore, grain, and wool), knights can play a major role in directing where the robber is placed. [...] As a rule of thumb, during your first settlement placement, it‚Äôs usually best not to point your road toward the middle of the board. You will likely have no expansion spots since everyone will start toward the middle, rather than the coast.
Anytime your road is in a contestable direction, make sure you‚Äôre the one cutting someone off or are more likely to win the race ‚Äî not the other way around. [...] It‚Äôs typically best to control the rare resource since the rest of the table will offer you generous trades for it. If you don‚Äôt budge, their games may stall while yours could still be progressing. Also, even if it makes you a target of the robber, you can leverage your rare resource as a bartering tool to keep the robber elsewhere.

#3. Relative production of complementary resources.

When looking for intersections to place your first Settlements, pay less attention to the type of resource and more attention to the number of dots on the hex tiles that make up the intersections.¬† The type of resource matters less than the frequency of obtaining them. After all, resources can be traded to the bank at 4:1 or at Ports for an even better return (see below). [...] You‚Äôll be the only one with that resource throughout the game ‚Äî never trade it away.
Trade Big or Trade with the Bank
Trading is a big part of Catan.
In the early rounds, when everyone is looking to expand, I‚Äôve noticed people are often willing to freely trade with other players.¬† Different strategies require different resources, so exchanges can almost seem friendly.
Later in the game, however, things are different. [...] More importantly, how badly do they need the resource you have?¬† Friendly trading takes place at a 1:1 ratio ‚Äî say, one wheat for one ore.¬† But friendly trading doesn‚Äôt win games. If you have a resource someone really needs, push for a 2:1 or 3:1 ratio.¬† And don‚Äôt limit yourself to expecting only one type of resource in exchange for the one you have that they really need.

Red has a very good setup here with good expansion options. He could go to the wheat port (6,2); to the 3:1 port (9,12) or to the 8,3 and brick port. Green‚Äôs setup on the other hand is not good. His strategy depends on getting to the wheat port.

A good ‚Äúemotional‚Äù strategy for red would be discussing this with green and conceding him the wheat port. [...] 1. Have at least 1 port

Trading is tougher in a top tier game. So it is very important to have access to ports.

When placing your 2 initial settlements try to think about which ¬†2:1 ports you will have access to and if they will have synergy with your resources. Also consider if you will have easy access to a 3:1 port.

Players who don‚Äôt have access to a good 2:1 port or to a 3:1 most often don‚Äôt win games in top tier level.

2. Track what cards are in each players hand

ExpansionsCatan has numerous expansions - one enables 5-6 players, and others include Seafarers, Cities & Knights, and Traders & Barbarians. Most of the advice I've given still largely holds, though many subtleties creep in and interesting additional mechanisms are brought into play.

There is even a Star Trek [...] Do:- everything you can to get your first city.

The ‚ÄúWood / Brick‚Äù strategy focuses primarily on building new settlements and roads. This strategy allows players to expand quickly, which can increase their resource gathering potential. By focusing on roads, players can not only reach desirable spots on the board more quickly, but can also cut off other player‚Äôs expansion opportunities. This strategy is also in a good position to build the longest road. There are two main downsides to this strategy. The first is that you cannot win the game [...] Let‚Äôs start by talking about some of the overall strategies you can take in Catan. The first strategy is the ‚ÄúBalanced Approach‚Äù. In this strategy you are simply trying to diversify your resources as much as possible by placing your settlements on a wide variety of resources, with a variety of different numbers. The goal of this strategy is to ensure that you have access to every material in the game, without relying on trading with other players or the bank. This is a very basic strategy that [...] The second resource-based strategy is the ‚ÄúOre / Wheat‚Äù Strategy. This strategy focuses on building cities and buying development cards, and lends itself towards getting the largest army card. By building cities as early as possible you can increase your resource gathering, with the added bonus that your first cities will probably be on your original settlements which should be in prime locations on the board. While you can technically win with only your first two cities, the largest army, and

    new_text: You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your goal is to analyze the game state thoroughly and make the optimal decision to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Second priority: Ensure access to ore and wheat for city development
- Aim to cover all five resources between your two settlements, or secure access to useful ports
- Place roads strategically toward future expansion opportunities, not toward the center
- Avoid placing settlements that will be "trapped" with no room to expand
- Consider starting near a port that matches resources you expect to have in abundance
- Look for spots where complementary resources (like brick/wood or ore/wheat) are adjacent

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Early-game: Secure brick and wood for settlements and roads to expand production
- Mid-game: Focus on ore and wheat for city upgrades (3 VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Always calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each building option (cities are most efficient)
- Track resource scarcity and use this for trading leverage
- Never trade resources that help opponents achieve immediate victory point gains

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You need monopoly/year of plenty to complete a crucial build
- Try to maintain largest army (2 VP) if you've already invested in multiple knights
- Save knights for defensive purposes if you're producing valuable resources

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity
- Target valuable ports that complement your production
- Block opponents' expansion when it threatens your strategy
- Build roads only with a clear settlement location in mind
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments
- If possible, coordinate robber placement to disrupt multiple strong opponents

TRADING TACTICS:
- Never accept 1:1 trades unless absolutely necessary for an immediate win
- Offer favorable trades early game to build goodwill; be ruthless late-game
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting bad player trades
- Track which resources opponents need and use that for leverage
- When trading with the bank, ensure the gained resource completes a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Misdirect opponents about your strategy when possible
- Prepare contingency plans if your primary strategy is blocked
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?================================= Tool Message =================================

Based on my analysis of the game logs and research, I've made several significant improvements to the prompt for PromptRefiningLLMPlayer_C:

### Key Improvements Made:

1. **Enhanced Initial Placement Strategy**
   - Added specific prioritization of high-probability numbers (6 & 8)
   - Emphasized the importance of avoiding "trapped" settlements with no expansion potential
   - Added guidance on complementary resource adjacency

2. **Resource Management**
   - Structured clear resource priorities for different game phases
   - Added VP-to-resource ratio calculation guidance
   - Emphasized the importance of tracking resource scarcity as a trading leverage

3. **Development Card Strategy**
   - Added specific scenarios when development cards are most valuable
   - Included guidance on knight card usage and timing
   - Added strategy for largest army acquisition

4. **Robber Placement Strategy**
   - Added sophisticated targeting criteria based on opponent strength
   - Included considerations for resource disruption
   - Added guidance on strategic knight card deployment

5. **Trading Tactics**
   - Provided clearer guidelines on acceptable trade ratios
   - Added specific recommendations about port trading vs. player trades
   - Emphasized the importance of tracking opponent needs

6. **Expansion and Endgame Strategy**
   - Added concrete guidance on settlement prioritization
   - Included advice on hiding victory point potential in the late game
   - Added contingency planning recommendation

The current performance shows our player is winning 2 out of 5 games, with an average of 7.2 victory points, while AlphaBetaPlayer wins 3 out of 5 with 9.0 victory points on average. The analysis of game logs revealed that our player:

1. Frequently made suboptimal initial placements
2. Didn't effectively leverage development card strategy
3. Made inefficient trading decisions
4. Didn't focus enough on city development (crucial for victory point efficiency)

The new prompt addresses all these weaknesses with specific, actionable guidance. It balances short-term thinking with long-term strategy, and ensures the player considers both offensive moves (building toward victory) and defensive tactics (blocking opponents).

The most significant improvement is the structured phase-based thinking, helping the LLM understand which resources and building types to prioritize at different stages of the game. This should substantially improve our player's decision-making and competitive performance against AlphaBetaPlayer.Evolve Counter: 8

Kudos to you for making it to the end. If you‚Äôre not an avid player and think a lot of this guide is excessive and was written by a crazy person overly obsessed with a board game..you‚Äôre probably right. [...] Additionally, since some of these tactics are a bit cold-blooded (doing whatever it takes to win), don‚Äôt expect everything included herein to keep your competition happy ‚Äî user discretion is advised. Even though Catan is just a game and you should be able to do what‚Äôs best to win, people do take moves personally. Sometimes keeping people happy at the expense of short-term wins builds goodwill that could pay off down the line.

The second resource-based strategy is the ‚ÄúOre / Wheat‚Äù Strategy. This strategy focuses on building cities and buying development cards, and lends itself towards getting the largest army card. By building cities as early as possible you can increase your resource gathering, with the added bonus that your first cities will probably be on your original settlements which should be in prime locations on the board. While you can technically win with only your first two cities, the largest army, and [...] I‚Äôve divided this guide into 5 main sections ‚Äì general strategies, settlement placement, development cards, the robber, and trading. If you want to skip to any of those sections you can use the video chapters, or the links in the description.
Strategies [...] In addition to your own development cards, it‚Äôs also important to keep track of your opponent‚Äôs development cards, so that you know how close everybody at the table is to winning. If you aren‚Äôt sure what development cards your opponents have, assume that it‚Äôs a victory point card (because even if it isn‚Äôt, it will likely help them acquire at least 1 victory point when they play it).

As a rule of thumb, during your first settlement placement, it‚Äôs usually best not to point your road toward the middle of the board. You will likely have no expansion spots since everyone will start toward the middle, rather than the coast.
Anytime your road is in a contestable direction, make sure you‚Äôre the one cutting someone off or are more likely to win the race ‚Äî not the other way around. [...] As mentioned earlier, competitor placements are just as significant as your own. Especially when placing your first settlement, you need to predict which spots may go untaken by the time the turn gets back to you. Therefore, simply picking what may look like the best spot at first glance may not be. [...] As a result, you will start with a road which gives you a great first mover advantage if you are in a race with anyone. This can help you secure a contested spot with your first settlement or deliberately cut someone off placing two roads from your second placement.
#13. Consider which spots will always be knighted.

In a development card heavy game (lots of ore, grain, and wool), knights can play a major role in directing where the robber is placed.

When looking for intersections to place your first Settlements, pay less attention to the type of resource and more attention to the number of dots on the hex tiles that make up the intersections.¬† The type of resource matters less than the frequency of obtaining them. After all, resources can be traded to the bank at 4:1 or at Ports for an even better return (see below).

- When I talk about gaining and losing dots, I'm talking about placing a settlement on a vertex and gaining access to the production of 3 tiles. Or, turning that settlement into a city and doubling production.
Here are some simple heuristics to help placement:
- On the first placement, just maximize your number of dots. You should never sacrifice more than 1 dot for any "Other factors". This placement will probably be 10-12 dots [...] Cities first strategy
Since cities double your earning power, an effective strategy can be to optimize for as much wheat and rock as you can get early in the game, upgrade to two cities as quickly as possible, and then trade out some of your abundant wheat and rock for wood and brick later to build roads and expand. If you can get access to sheep with this strategy, you can also quickly and easily pursue a strategy of buying a lot of development cards before building more settlements. [...] If you are lucky enough to place last, place your better settlement second. Settlers uses what is called a switch-back start: each player, in turn order, places their first settlement, and then in reverse turn order they place their second. This second settlement immediately produces the resources it is placed on. This is a significant advantage to the last player, who places both settlements at the same time.

According to computer simulation tests, the best strategy for winning Catan is the Development Card Strategy.

6. What‚Äôs the Development Card Strategy?

The Catan Development Card Strategy focuses on ignoring wood and brick during the initial placement of settlements and instead prioritizing ore, wheat, and sheep. While it may sound counter intuitive, as wood and brick are essential to expanding your civilization, focusing on these higher-valued resources can be very lucrative.

My favorite strategy in Catan is the development card strategy. One of the biggest reasons I love this strategy so much is because I win with this strategy more than any other strategy. [...] in this video we're going to go through the development card strategy for Catan so that you can win your next game first part in this strategy is placement now this is the development card strategy so you're going to need wheat sheep and or and these three resources are what you're going to use throughout the game to get development cards so we're going to when you're looking at your first placement try and find a location that is good for that so for example we've got four wheat sheep or sheep [...] to start off with because you want to be wrapping up ranking up your resources but let's say that I was able to trade this to one of my teammates for sheep I'm just gonna place then you'd get another resource card and you've got the start of your army which remember army is only two victory points now a pro of this strategy of focusing on getting development cards is as you're getting development cards there are five victory points in this deck plus you've got the largest army so you have the

3rd Player. Initial placement 5 ore, 4 wheat, 8 wheat, 11 wood, 6 brick. Won. Despite my best efforts to play a Development Card strategy, the best placements for ore and wheat gave me brick and wood, so this one played more like an expansion strategy. I finished with longest road, largest army, 2 cities, 2 settlements, and 1 bonus point.
4th Player. Initial placement 4 ore, 3 wheat, 8 sheep, 5 sheep, 11 sheep. Lost. This strategy is not viable with such low quantities of ore and wheat. [...] The concept for the Development Card Strategy is to ignore wood and brick completely when you are placing your initial settlements. Instead, you want, in order, Ore, Wheat, and Sheep. Cities and Development Cards are your friends.  
To achieve 10 victory points, most of the time you'll want to: [...] Establish one settlement in addition to your starting 2. You'll need to trade for the Wood and Brick that you need or use Year of Plenty, Monopoly, or Road Building to help yourself out.


Turn all three settlements into cities. This should be the easiest part of the strategy considering how much Ore and Wheat you'll be producing.

    new_text: You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Place settlements on high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Target at least one spot with good ore and wheat production for city development
- Try to secure at least one high-probability spot (5, 6, 8, 9) for each critical resource
- Place your second settlement to complement your first (fill resource gaps)
- Aim for access to all five resources or position near useful ports if resource diversity isn't possible
- Always consider which settlements opponents are likely to place and avoid areas that will become contested
- Place roads pointing toward valuable future expansion spots, not toward the center
- Consider the long-term impact: settlements that can't expand are less valuable

MID-GAME RESOURCE PRIORITIES:
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each possible build (cities: 1VP for 5 resources is most efficient)
- Early phase: Secure at least one good source of brick and wood for minimal expansion
- Growth phase: Prioritize ore and wheat production for city upgrades (3VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Late phase: Focus on the fastest path to victory points, whether through buildings or development cards
- Avoid trading resources that opponents need for immediate victory point gains
- Use 4:1 trades only when necessary; prioritize port usage when possible

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- If you get an early knight, save it for defense or until you can start building toward largest army
- Time monopoly card usage for when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Save year of plenty cards for completing crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army
  * You're lacking wood/brick for expansion but have plenty of sheep/wheat/ore

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Target settlements that give you access to ports or new resources
- Block opponents' expansion paths when it gives you a strategic advantage
- Consider the timing of expansion vs. city upgrades based on your resource production
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns

ROBBER STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-probability hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't access easily
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Save knight cards for breaking up opponent strategies or securing largest army
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes

TRADING TACTICS:
- Avoid trading resources that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Consider bank/port trades when they enable an immediate build that advances your strategy
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Be aware of the exact number of remaining development cards and their probabilities
- Track opponents' potential victory points, including hidden development cards
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Are you properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex

I've significantly improved the prompt for the Catan player. Here are the key improvements I made:

1. **Enhanced Initial Settlement Strategy**:
   - Added specific guidance on targeting high-probability numbers
   - Emphasized the importance of planning ahead for resource complementarity
   - Added consideration of opponent placement strategies
   - Included road placement guidance to avoid getting trapped

2. **Improved Resource Management**:
   - Added phased approach to resource priorities (early, growth, late game)
   - Incorporated VP-to-resource ratio calculations for more efficient building
   - Added guidance on when to use 4:1 trades vs. ports

3. **Optimized Development Card Strategy**:
   - Added specific timing guidance for each type of development card
   - Provided clear scenarios for when to prioritize development cards
   - Added defensive uses for knight cards

4. **Better Expansion Strategy**:
   - Added guidance to build roads only with clear settlement targets
   - Incorporated strategic blocking of opponents
   - Added comparative decision-making between settlements vs. cities

5. **Refined Robber Strategy**:
   - Added targeting of players closest to winning, not just any opponent
   - Included strategy for choosing which resources to block
   - Added defensive knight usage

6. **Enhanced Trading Tactics**:
   - Added risk management for trading that might help opponents
   - Included pre-roll-7 trading to avoid discards
   - Added specific guidance on bank/port trades

7. **New Endgame Strategy**:
   - Added victory point calculation and focus
   - Included opponent tracking
   - Added guidance on hidden victory points

These improvements address the key weaknesses observed in the game logs where the player sometimes made sub-optimal decisions about resource management, settlement placement, and development card usage. The new prompt should help the player make more strategic decisions throughout all phases of the game.

The improved prompt maintains all the essential rules and board understanding guidance but adds much more specific strategic advice that should help our player win more consistently against the AlphaBetaPlayer.Evolve Counter: 7

You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)================================== Ai Message ==================================

This strategy focuses on development cards, building other things only as an aside when development and resource cards dictate it. They'll usually end up with the Largest Army card and the lion's share of the victory point cards, and generally make a fabulous nuisance of themselves. This is a great strategy if you have good ore/wheat/sheep balance, but is always fun to play, especially because you'll be dropping the robber all over the place but your board position will appear sufficiently weak [...] Do:- keep your options open. This strategy and the Commander are only subtly different, and if you have 3 ore, 2 wheat and 2 sheep early, you might just want to build that city instead of buying two development cards.- secure about same amount of ore as wheat, and 2/3 of this amount of sheep. You really don‚Äôt need any brick or wood to speak of when playing this strategy - you'll get all you need from development cards and robbing other players.

Cities and Development Cards - For this strategy, your main resources would be Wool, Wheat, and Ore

Trade 2 of a Kind - You will need a 2:1 port and a high concentration of that resource.

With these in mind, and the map layout, identify which strategy will be easier to execute.

2. Resources and Numbers

Colonist is one of those online games that not only requires a keen eye in strategy, but also good sense in resource management. [...] In addition, this would also give you a pretty good idea on how you would want your game to progress.

There are three main strategies you can focus on:

Settlements and Longest Road - Your essential resources would be high amount of Lumber, Brick and some amount of Wool, and Wheat.

Hybrid Expansion ¬†- Occupying as much as you can of the map thereby acquiring more resources. For this strategy you will need to produce a balanced amount of all resources.

It probably goes without saying, but robber placement should hinder the biggest threat to you and in general, experienced Catan gamers will be understanding if that‚Äôs what you do.  Less forgiving is when you use it early on, hitting many people at once.  That tends to leave a bad taste in people‚Äôs mouths as they look for retribution.  Having multiple people gunning for you is not fun.  Also, if you can‚Äôt figure out who to sic the robber on, place it on the person to your right.  There‚Äôs a high

- try to avoid trading down to just a few cards with the bank and being stuck unable to build. Chances are, you're doing so for a resource you're finding hard to get and therefore other players will know they can disproportionately hurt you with the robber if they steal it.

- preserve juicy settlement locations with judicious road placement. Lock up that port that's critical to your strategy early. Nothing more infuriating than having an opponent beat you to it. [...] Using the robber well is crucial - on average, the robber will turn up once in every six rolls and it also gets moved when playing a knight.

- use it on the person in the strongest position (not necessarily the open points leader). Count unplayed development cards in someone's hand as points. Someone who gets Longest Road early is rarely a threat in the long term.

- use the robber exclusively on your strongest opponent. Avoid motivating more than one of your opponents to seek revenge! [...] - if you are lacking a resource, don't place the robber on it. You want there to be lots of it in the game so people will trade it to you. Instead, place it on a resource that you have a lot of so you can increase your probability of trading for what you need.

The second resource-based strategy is the ‚ÄúOre / Wheat‚Äù Strategy. This strategy focuses on building cities and buying development cards, and lends itself towards getting the largest army card. By building cities as early as possible you can increase your resource gathering, with the added bonus that your first cities will probably be on your original settlements which should be in prime locations on the board. While you can technically win with only your first two cities, the largest army, and [...] While you should definitely prioritize the resources that benefit your strategy, building on highly productive intersections is very important due to the exponential nature of Catan. Building settlements and cities increases your resource gathering ability, which in turn makes it easier to build. If you are able to start the game with great resources, your production will just get better and better over time. On the other hand, if you start on low production tiles you will inevitably fall [...] Rather than attempting to collect every resource, it‚Äôs generally more effective to focus on only a few resources. The two main ways to do this are the ‚ÄúWood / Brick‚Äù strategy, and the ‚ÄúOre / Wheat‚Äù strategy.

If your strategy doesn't involve the Longest Road, try to point your road towards two open intersections. You'll then be able to fork it and build two more settlements at a cost of 2 roads instead of 3.

Step 3: Resources

The resources are not created equally. There are 19 tiles:

3 Brick | 3 Ore | 4 Sheep | 4 Wheat | 4 Wood | 1 Desert (0 production) [...] This strategy aims first to build two cities before attempting to build roads or settlements. Players who like this strategy look for rich placements on ore and wheat and don't worry much about brick and wood. They collect lots of development cards and a typical winning combination will involve 3 cities, 2 victory point cards and largest army. Road building is most often done with the appropriate development card. It's quite possible to win this way without producing a single brick or wood in [...] Do:- keep your options open. This strategy and the Commander are only subtly different, and if you have 3 ore, 2 wheat and 2 sheep early, you might just want to build that city instead of buying two development cards.- secure about same amount of ore as wheat, and 2/3 of this amount of sheep.

- When I talk about gaining and losing dots, I'm talking about placing a settlement on a vertex and gaining access to the production of 3 tiles. Or, turning that settlement into a city and doubling production.
Here are some simple heuristics to help placement:
- On the first placement, just maximize your number of dots. You should never sacrifice more than 1 dot for any "Other factors". This placement will probably be 10-12 dots

    new_text: You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist. Your goal is to analyze the game state thoroughly and make the optimal decision to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Second priority: Ensure access to ore and wheat for city development
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Place your two initial settlements on opposite sides of the board for flexibility
- Aim to cover all five resources between your two settlements, or secure access to useful ports
- Place roads strategically toward future expansion opportunities, not toward the center
- Consider starting near a port that matches resources you expect to have in abundance

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT STRATEGY:
- Early-game: Secure brick and wood for minimal expansion to critical resource spots
- Growth phase: Focus on ore and wheat for city upgrades (3 VP for 5 resources is optimal)
- Always calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each building option (cities are most efficient)
- Track which resources are scarce and use this for trading leverage
- Balance resources to avoid holding 7+ cards when dice rolls happen
- Use 4:1 trades only when they complete a critical build; prioritize port usage

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- Development cards are most valuable when:
  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents
  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army (2 VP)
  * You need monopoly/year of plenty to complete a crucial build
- Save knights for defensive purposes if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes
- When revealing victory point cards, time it to ensure your victory in a single turn if possible

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity
- Target valuable ports that complement your production
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- Build roads only with a clear settlement location in mind
- Block opponents' expansion when it threatens your strategy

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments
- If possible, coordinate robber placement to disrupt multiple strong opponents

TRADING TACTICS:
- Never accept trades that directly help opponents score points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Track which resources opponents need and use that for leverage
- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards

ENDGAME STRATEGY:
- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)
- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path
- Misdirect opponents about your strategy when possible
- Consider buying development cards to gain hidden victory points
- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)================================= Tool Message =================================

current_prompt.txt updated successfully================================== Ai Message ==================================

Based on my analysis of the game logs, performance history, and research on effective Catan strategies, I've made several improvements to the prompt:

1. **Enhanced Initial Placement Strategy**:
   - Added specific guidance on targeting high-probability numbers (6 & 8)
   - Emphasized placing settlements on complementary resource intersections
   - Added strategy for placing settlements on opposite sides of the board for expansion flexibility
   - Prioritized ore and wheat access for city development

2. **Improved Resource Management**:
   - Added phased approach (early-game, growth phase)
   - Emphasized VP-to-resource ratio calculation for more efficient building
   - Included guidance on avoiding holding 7+ cards before dice rolls
   - Added more strategic advice about port usage and trading

3. **Development Card Optimization**:
   - Provided clearer guidance on when to buy and use development cards
   - Added specific advice on largest army strategy
   - Included defensive use of knights to protect valuable resources

4. **Refined Robber Placement**:
   - Added more strategic considerations for robber placement targeting opponents
   - Included advice on knight card timing and defensive play
   - Added guidance on stealing resources that support your next build

5. **Enhanced Trading Tactics**:
   - Added more strategic trading considerations
   - Emphasized port trading for independence from unfavorable player trades
   - Added advice about trading excess resources before rolling a 7

6. **Strengthened Endgame Strategy**:
   - Added specific guidance on hiding victory point potential
   - Emphasized calculating the fastest path to 10 VP
   - Added strategic considerations for misdirection

The prompt now provides a more comprehensive and balanced approach to Catan strategy, addressing the key areas where I noticed our player could improve. I've retained the structured format that was working well while adding more specific tactical advice.

The performance history shows that our player's win rate has been steadily improving with each prompt refinement, going from 1 win to 3 wins in the latest games. The updated prompt should continue this positive trend by providing even more strategic depth and nuanced decision-making guidance.Evolve Counter: 6

Your goal is to analyze the game state thoroughly and make the optimal decision to maximize your chances of winning.\n\nRules:\n1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions\n2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points\n3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \\boxed{5}\n4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number\n5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:\n   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>\n\nINITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:\n- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources\n- Second priority: Ensure access to ore and wheat for city development\n- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)\n- Place your two initial settlements on opposite sides of the board for flexibility\n- Aim to cover all five resources between your two settlements, or secure access to useful ports\n- Place roads strategically toward future expansion opportunities, not toward the center\n- Consider starting near a port that matches resources you expect to have in abundance\n\nRESOURCE MANAGEMENT STRATEGY:\n- Early-game: Secure brick and wood for minimal expansion to critical resource spots\n- Growth phase: Focus on ore and wheat for city upgrades (3 VP for 5 resources is optimal)\n- Always calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each building option (cities are most efficient)\n- Track which resources are scarce and use this for trading leverage\n- Balance resources to avoid holding 7+ cards when dice rolls happen\n- Use 4:1 trades only when they complete a critical build; prioritize port usage\n\nDEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:\n- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options\n- Development cards are most valuable when:\n  * You need hidden victory points to surprise opponents\n  * You need knights to break up longest road or secure largest army (2 VP)\n  * You need monopoly/year of plenty to complete a crucial build\n- Save knights for defensive purposes if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes\n- When revealing victory point cards, time it to ensure your victory in a single turn if possible\n\nEXPANSION STRATEGY:\n- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity\n- Target valuable ports that complement your production\n- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment\n- Build roads only with a clear settlement location in mind\n- Block opponents' expansion when it threatens your strategy\n\nROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:\n- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning\n- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access\n- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build\n- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments\n- If possible, coordinate robber placement to disrupt multiple strong opponents\n\nTRADING TACTICS:\n- Never accept trades that directly help opponents score points\n- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades\n- Track which resources opponents need and use that for leverage\n- When trading with players, try to receive resources that complete a build\n- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards\n\nENDGAME STRATEGY:\n- In the late game, hide your victory point potential (keep development cards hidden)\n- Calculate the fastest path to 10 VP and focus exclusively on that path\n- Misdirect opponents about your strategy when possible\n- Consider buying development cards to gain hidden victory points\n- If you're close to winning, prioritize actions that can be completed in a single turn\n\nBefore finalizing your action, check:\n1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?\n2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?\n3. Does this move help or hinder opponents?\n4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?\n\nBoard Understanding Guide:\n- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers\n- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile\n- \ud83d\udd0d marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex\n- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section\n- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy\n- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)",

2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

- try to avoid trading down to just a few cards with the bank and being stuck unable to build. Chances are, you're doing so for a resource you're finding hard to get and therefore other players will know they can disproportionately hurt you with the robber if they steal it.

- preserve juicy settlement locations with judicious road placement. Lock up that port that's critical to your strategy early. Nothing more infuriating than having an opponent beat you to it. [...] 1. Get one of everything. You're going to need all of wood, brick, wheat, sheep, and ore, so why not make sure you have them all at the start? Place your first settlement so you get 3 different resources, and pick up the final 2 with your last placement. [...] You need to point these towards where you would like to build your next settlement. This will nearly always be towards the outside of the board. Don't bother pointing it at that empty 5/9/10 intersection - someone will occupy it for sure. That 4/9 port? Perfect. Road placement is all about second-guessing your opponents: you basically want to point your road at the (n+1)th best position left on the board where n = the number of settlement placements left. This is tough on round 1 of placements

As a rule of thumb, during your first settlement placement, it‚Äôs usually best not to point your road toward the middle of the board. You will likely have no expansion spots since everyone will start toward the middle, rather than the coast.
Anytime your road is in a contestable direction, make sure you‚Äôre the one cutting someone off or are more likely to win the race ‚Äî not the other way around. [...] As mentioned earlier, competitor placements are just as significant as your own. Especially when placing your first settlement, you need to predict which spots may go untaken by the time the turn gets back to you. Therefore, simply picking what may look like the best spot at first glance may not be. [...] Taking a port-focused approach offers flexibility trading in your cards and may make you less vulnerable to being robbed.
If you have an excess supply of a specific resource for porting, this is likely to be an undesirable, common card that another player will not want to pick.
#12. What resources you start the game with can make a difference.

The most common tactic on this thread is placing your settlement adjacent to both lumber and brick.

Overall, placing your starting settlements wisely will give you a huge advantage in Settlers of Catan. But this is just one of the many strategies that can be employed in the game.

It is very hard to employ all these tactics in every game though, as the board is arranged randomly by the system and your neighbors choices restrict yours.

However, having a good grasp of starting positions and initial placements will help greatly in winning you your next Colonist game. [...] Colonist Strategies: What are the Best Catan Starting Strategies?

Today we will be giving you pointers on the best starting placement strategies for Settlers of Catan that you can use in Colonist.

Colonist.io

1. Identify Your Goals

The first and most important Catan Strategy is knowing what you want to build. This will dictate which resources you should go after when you place your starting settlements. [...] 3. Scarcity - Monopolizing Resources

While placing the first settlement. Going for scarcity is usually a good option. This means that if there isn‚Äôt much of a certain resource and you can monopolize that resource do it.

Trading that resource to others will be a piece of cake since they will not be able to obtain that resource easily with other methods.

4. Observe Thy Neighbor

This strategy focuses on development cards, building other things only as an aside when development and resource cards dictate it. They'll usually end up with the Largest Army card and the lion's share of the victory point cards, and generally make a fabulous nuisance of themselves. This is a great strategy if you have good ore/wheat/sheep balance, but is always fun to play, especially because you'll be dropping the robber all over the place but your board position will appear sufficiently weak [...] This strategy aims first to build two cities before attempting to build roads or settlements. Players who like this strategy look for rich placements on ore and wheat and don't worry much about brick and wood. They collect lots of development cards and a typical winning combination will involve 3 cities, 2 victory point cards and largest army. Road building is most often done with the appropriate development card. It's quite possible to win this way without producing a single brick or wood in [...] - the Commander is an ore whore and the best way to stop them is denying them early cities by blocking those tiles and refusing to trade them what they crave.

- encroach on the Developer and strangle their productivity. Try not to trade them ore/wheat/sheep - if you let them buy a card every turn, they're going to win.

Here are some examples:

Cut people off

Don‚Äôt get cut off

4. Avoid being the clear leader

5. Diversify your resources and number production

6. How to play your development cards

7. Robbers can decide games

Here are some pointers:

8. Always speak up

9. Think about win-scenarios

10. The person with the most points isn‚Äôt always winning

11. Yes, 11‚Äôs and 3‚Äôs roll

12. Table presence

13. Card tracking

<Document href="https://www.landofgeek.com/posts/how-to-win-catan"/>
You want to level up fast. Prioritize ore and wheat, get cities early, and rack up production. Add sheep and start buying development cards for Largest Army and victory points. It√¢¬Ä¬ôs slower to start but scales like crazy.

Best when: You get strong 6/8 ore-wheat spots, ideally paired with sheep.

4. Port Strategy [...] And remember: don√¢¬Ä¬ôt hoard too many cards. Hit 8, and a robber roll can ruin your plans. If you're holding a hand of 9 cards and waiting to build a city or buy dev cards, do it now or trade it down.

The important thing to note about messing with the player on your right is not to be a jerk. Always give a reason why you are playing the robber on them. Don‚Äôt say, ‚ÄúWell, I read a guide and it said to put in on the player to my right, so that‚Äôs what I am doing.‚Äù Instead say, ‚ÄúWell, we rolled wheat a couple of turns ago and I really needed one.‚Äù That person may come back with ‚Äì ‚ÄúWell, you just got two wheat.‚Äù Just say, ‚ÄúOh, I was trying to go for a 3 for 1 trade.‚Äù If they want to know why you [...] If someone wants to trade something and you are the only one offering, try to get them to wait until your turn to trade it. Trading another player on his turn benefits him greatly because he can use his new cards right away. Trading with someone on your turn will benefit you more than them for the same reason. You may need to make up an excuse like, ‚ÄúOh, man, if I have the card you need, but I need it to. If I get the roll I am looking for, I can trade it. Just let me roll first.‚Äù If they can [...] out of pity. ‚ÄúWell, I did put the robber on you, so I guess I‚Äôll make the trade with you instead of with the other guy.‚Äù Again, the ‚Äúaw shucks‚Äù should work like a charm.

Catan: Cities & Knights has an extra provision (a variant, if you will) that allows for the Robber to only come to Catan when the first Barbarian invaders land.

Mastering the Robber‚Äôs placement is critical. For example, targeting high-value hexes like ore or wheat can cripple opponents‚Äô strategies. Learn how to weaponize the Robber in our guide to Catan Robber Placement: Your Key to Victory and discover advanced tactics like bluffing with

Friendly Robber[] [...] Another possible trait of the friendlier robber is a streak of Robin Hood. This robber will never hurt the player(s) with the fewest points. Incidentally, this encompasses the previously described behavior.

Using the Friendly Robber early game? Pair it with smart negotiation tactics outlined in Catan Trade Master: How to Negotiate Like a Pro to maintain alliances while building your resource engine.

Resources[] [...] In The Settlers of Catan, the Robber begins the game in the desert hex. However, as the game continues, the Robber moves to other hexes. Whenever a "7" is rolled on the dice (and it is rolled quite often due to it being the most frequent combination), the Robber strikes. The player who rolled the number takes the Robber and moves it to a hex of his or her choice. That player then steals a resource or commodity from the hand of one of the opponents bordering that hex. Until another "7" is rolled

    new_text: You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist and expert modeler of opponent behavior. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL SETTLEMENT PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Aim for access to brick and wood for early expansion, then ore and wheat for city development 
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each resource or access to relevant ports
- Place roads pointing toward future expansion opportunities or to block opponent expansion
- Never place settlements that will be "trapped" with no room to expand
- Prioritize nodes where you can access three different resources over nodes with fewer resources
- If you can't get access to all resources, prioritize wheat (most versatile) and ore (for cities)
- When placing second settlement, consider what resources your first settlement is missing

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT STRATEGY:
- Early-game (0-4 VP): Focus on brick and wood to expand to high-value spots quickly
- Mid-game (4-7 VP): Transition to ore and wheat focus for city upgrades (most efficient VP/resource ratio)
- Late-game (7+ VP): Prioritize the fastest path to victory, often through development cards
- Never trade resources that help opponents score immediate victory points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting 4:1 trades
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities are most efficient)
- Trade excess resources before rolling 7 if you have more than 7 cards
- Avoid over-specializing in just 1-2 resources as this makes you vulnerable to the robber

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- Save knight cards for defensive purposes to protect high-production hexes
- Time monopoly card usage when opponents likely have accumulated specific resources
- Use year of plenty to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- If you've played 2+ knights, aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP)
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages - buy them when stuck

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
- Build roads only with clear settlement locations in mind
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Target settlements near ports that complement your production
- Block opponents' expansion when it threatens your growth opportunities
- Calculate whether longest road is achievable and worth the resource investment
- When deciding between a new settlement and a city upgrade, compare immediate vs. long-term returns
- Position settlements to control key expansion routes, even if initial production is lower

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Use knights defensively if you're producing valuable resources on high-probability hexes
- Consider coordinating robber placement to disrupt multiple opponents simultaneously
- Avoid placing the robber where it hurts all players equally - target selectively

OPPONENT MODELING:
- Track which resources opponents are collecting and what they likely need next
- Pay attention to opponents' building patterns to predict their strategies
- Block expansion paths of players who are closest to winning
- Assess which opponent is the biggest threat based on visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

Before finalizing your action, check:
1. Is this the most efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this position me for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Does this help or hinder opponents?
4. Is there a defensive move needed to prevent an opponent from winning?
5. Am I properly diversified against dice probability?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy

Based on my analysis of the game logs, performance history, and research, I've made several strategic improvements to the prompt to help promptRefiningLLM_player_C win against AlphaBetaPlayer.

Here's a summary of the key improvements I've made:

1. **Enhanced Initial Settlement Strategy**:
   - Added specific guidance on targeting high-probability numbers (6 & 8)
   - Emphasized securing brick and wood early for expansion, then transitioning to ore and wheat
   - Added advice on placing settlements at intersections of complementary resources
   - Included guidance on avoiding "trapped" settlements with no expansion potential

2. **Resource Management Optimization**:
   - Created a phased approach: early game (brick/wood), mid-game (ore/wheat), late-game (fastest path)
   - Added specific warnings against trading resources that help opponents score points
   - Emphasized port trading over unfavorable 4:1 trades
   - Added VP-to-resource ratio calculation for efficient building decisions

3. **Development Card Strategy**:
   - Included specific timing guidelines for different development cards
   - Added defensive advice for knight cards
   - Emphasized the importance of pursuing largest army when 2+ knights are played

4. **Expansion Strategy Improvements**:
   - Added guidance to build roads with clear settlement goals
   - Emphasized blocking opponents' expansion paths
   - Added guidance on settlement placement for diversity and port access

5. **Robber Placement Tactics**:
   - Added specific targeting strategy: highest-value hex of the leading player
   - Included guidance on using knights defensively
   - Added coordination strategy for disrupting multiple opponents

6. **Opponent Modeling**:
   - Added a completely new section on tracking opponent resources and strategies
   - Included guidance on threat assessment based on visible and hidden points
   - Added advice on avoiding appearing to be in the lead until ready to win

This improved prompt should help the player make better strategic decisions throughout the game, with particular focus on the weaknesses identified in the previous games, such as poor initial placement, ineffective resource management, and lack of a clear path to victory.

The prompt now guides the player to think more strategically about each phase of the game and to consider the opponent's position when making decisions, which should lead to significantly better performance against the AlphaBetaPlayer.Evolve Counter: 5

Rather than attempting to collect every resource, it‚Äôs generally more effective to focus on only a few resources. The two main ways to do this are the ‚ÄúWood / Brick‚Äù strategy, and the ‚ÄúOre / Wheat‚Äù strategy. [...] Let‚Äôs start by talking about some of the overall strategies you can take in Catan. The first strategy is the ‚ÄúBalanced Approach‚Äù. In this strategy you are simply trying to diversify your resources as much as possible by placing your settlements on a wide variety of resources, with a variety of different numbers. The goal of this strategy is to ensure that you have access to every material in the game, without relying on trading with other players or the bank. This is a very basic strategy that [...] The second resource-based strategy is the ‚ÄúOre / Wheat‚Äù Strategy. This strategy focuses on building cities and buying development cards, and lends itself towards getting the largest army card.

This strategy aims first to build two cities before attempting to build roads or settlements. Players who like this strategy look for rich placements on ore and wheat and don't worry much about brick and wood. They collect lots of development cards and a typical winning combination will involve 3 cities, 2 victory point cards and largest army. Road building is most often done with the appropriate development card. It's quite possible to win this way without producing a single brick or wood in [...] The last 4 photos show what you need to build roads, settlements, cities and development cards. Wheat is uniquely a part of 3 different builds, so is the one resource everyone should make sure they have. Ore always needs wheat in order to be played. Wood and brick are always used together in even amounts, so try to balance these. If you end up with a big excess of a resource over something it pairs with, your plans had better include a port. The fact that the same amount of brick and wood are [...] Good when the following are true:- you can secure a strong supply of brick and wood- you can see a way to get the ore you need for your cities late in the game- you can get to a port to get late-game ore/wheat when wood/brick is less valuable- everyone else is going for another strategy

This is about speed and map control. You get wood and brick early, expand fast, grab key settlement locations, and go for Longest Road. It√¢¬Ä¬ôs great for disrupting others but struggles late-game without access to ore for cities.

Curiously, increasing the search to 3-layers deep made the bot play worse than when searching 2-layers deep. I think its either a bug in the implementation or maybe looking too much ahead makes the bot go frequently towards high-risk-high-reward plays that don‚Äôt pan out. [...] The last tool in the arsenal was to try and add ‚Äúsearch‚Äù to the ValueFunctionPlayer. There was only one slight modification that I did to the standard Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm, which was to take the expected value of the children when propagating values up the tree. This was to account the uncertainty in dice rolls, buying development cards, and stealing.

In theory, you should aim to have equal ‚Äúbips‚Äù of brick and lumber, as well as, 3:2 bips for ore and grain (notice ‚Äî this equates to a city). [...] Think of a Catan map as having 3 areas ‚Äî the center, inner, and coastal rings. The ‚Äúcenter‚Äù is all the spots around the middle hex, ‚Äúinner‚Äù is the next one outward, and so on.
For starters, the coast never makes sense for your first placement as it will only have 2 hexes of production (3 for you to build more central) and it will inhibit your optionality to expand.

- try to avoid trading down to just a few cards with the bank and being stuck unable to build. Chances are, you're doing so for a resource you're finding hard to get and therefore other players will know they can disproportionately hurt you with the robber if they steal it.

- preserve juicy settlement locations with judicious road placement. Lock up that port that's critical to your strategy early. Nothing more infuriating than having an opponent beat you to it. [...] - if you are lacking a resource, don't place the robber on it. You want there to be lots of it in the game so people will trade it to you. Instead, place it on a resource that you have a lot of so you can increase your probability of trading for what you need.

Step 7: Commander [...] Using the robber well is crucial - on average, the robber will turn up once in every six rolls and it also gets moved when playing a knight.

- use it on the person in the strongest position (not necessarily the open points leader). Count unplayed development cards in someone's hand as points. Someone who gets Longest Road early is rarely a threat in the long term.

- use the robber exclusively on your strongest opponent. Avoid motivating more than one of your opponents to seek revenge!

    new_text: You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert planning abilities. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Prioritize high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources, especially ore and wheat
- Place your two initial settlements to secure complementary resources - aim for all five resources
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, brick, and wood
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it sheep (unless a sheep-port is available)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas, not toward the center
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance
- Anticipate your opponent's likely placements and block their optimal spots when possible

RESOURCE PRODUCTION STRATEGY:
- Early-game (0-4 VP): Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game (4-7 VP): Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Always calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:
- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Victory point cards provide critical hidden points - opponents won't block what they can't see

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Assess the fastest path to 10 VP between these options:
  * 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + initial settlements (2 VP) + development card VPs (0-4 VP)
  * 2-3 cities (4-6 VP) + 3-4 settlements (3-4 VP) + longest road/largest army (2 VP)
- Constantly recalculate your most efficient path as the game progresses
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns
- In the late game, focus exclusively on your chosen path to victory

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades
- Calculate the opportunity cost of each trade - is it worth helping your opponent?
- Track which resources are scarce and use this for trading leverage
- When trading with the bank, ensure the gained resource completes a build
- Never trade resources that help opponents achieve immediate victory point gains

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

Before finalizing your action, always check:
1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?
2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
3. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?

I've created a significantly improved prompt for your Catan player with several key enhancements:

### Major Improvements Made:

1. **Upgraded Initial Placement Strategy**
   - Added specific guidance on prioritizing ore and wheat (essential for the city-building strategy)
   - Emphasized the importance of placing settlements on complementary resources
   - Added advice to anticipate and block opponent's optimal placements

2. **More Effective Resource Management**
   - Implemented a phase-based resource strategy (early/mid/late game)
   - Prioritized ore and wheat for city upgrades as they provide the best VP-to-resource ratio
   - Added specific guidance to target 2-3 cities before extensive road building

3. **Enhanced Development Card Strategy**
   - Provided clearer guidance on when to buy and how to use different development cards
   - Added strategic timing for knight cards, monopoly and year of plenty cards
   - Emphasized the value of hidden victory points from development cards

4. **Smarter Robber Placement**
   - Added specific targeting strategy to place the robber on the player closest to winning
   - Added guidance on which hexes to target for maximum impact
   - Included advice to avoid placing the robber on resources you're deficient in

5. **Clearer Path to Victory Planning**
   - Added specific VP calculations for different winning strategies
   - Emphasized the importance of constantly recalculating the most efficient path
   - Added guidance on tracking opponent's potential points and timing your win

6. **More Strategic Trading**
   - Emphasized port trading over unfavorable player trades
   - Added consideration of opportunity costs in trading
   - Provided guidance on leveraging resource scarcity

The prompt now incorporates a balanced approach that emphasizes city building (the ore/wheat strategy) while maintaining enough flexibility for expansion through settlements and roads. This should help your player make more strategic decisions and outperform the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.

You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)================================== Ai Message ==================================

If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:\n   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>\n\nINITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:\n- Prioritize high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources, especially ore and wheat\n- Place your two initial settlements to secure complementary resources - aim for all five resources\n- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, brick, and wood\n- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it sheep (unless a sheep-port is available)\n- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities\n- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas, not toward the center\n- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance\n- Anticipate your opponent's likely placements and block their optimal spots when possible\n\nRESOURCE PRODUCTION STRATEGY:\n- Early-game (0-4 VP): Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports\n- Mid-game (4-7 VP): Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities\n- Always calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)\n- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road\n- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls\n- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points\n\nDEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY:\n- Buy development cards when you have excess sheep/wheat/ore and limited expansion options\n- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber\n- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need\n- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short 1-2 specific resources\n- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights\n- Victory point cards provide critical hidden points - opponents won't block what they can't see\n\nROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:\n- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning\n- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access\n- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build\n- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic\n- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options\n\nEXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:\n- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations\n- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability\n- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment\n- Block opponents' critical expansion paths\n- Secure key ports that complement your resource production\n\nPATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:\n- Assess the fastest path to 10 VP between these options:\n  * 3-4 cities (6-8 VP) + initial settlements (2 VP) + development card VPs (0-4 VP)\n  * 2-3 cities (4-6 VP) + 3-4 settlements (3-4 VP) + longest road/largest army (2 VP)\n- Constantly recalculate your most efficient path as the game progresses\n- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points\n- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns\n- In the late game, focus exclusively on your chosen path to victory\n\nTRADING STRATEGY:\n- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades\n- Calculate the opportunity cost of each trade - is it worth helping your opponent?\n- Track which resources are scarce and use this for trading leverage\n- When trading with the bank, ensure the gained resource completes a build\n- Never trade resources that help opponents achieve immediate victory point gains\n\nBoard Understanding Guide:\n- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers\n- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile\n- \ud83d\udd0d marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex\n- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section\n- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy\n- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)\n\nBefore finalizing your action, always check:\n1. Is there a more efficient path to victory points?\n2. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?\n3. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?\n4. Are you balancing immediate gains vs. long-term development?",

This strategy focuses on development cards, building other things only as an aside when development and resource cards dictate it. They'll usually end up with the Largest Army card and the lion's share of the victory point cards, and generally make a fabulous nuisance of themselves. This is a great strategy if you have good ore/wheat/sheep balance, but is always fun to play, especially because you'll be dropping the robber all over the place but your board position will appear sufficiently weak [...] Obvious leads make you a target. Longest Road in particular should be picked up as late as possible. Joining up two separate road segments with a big road-building push and unveiling 2 victory point cards can give you the win from 6 points. Largest Army on the other hand needs to be more openly competed for, because of the play-only-one-development-card-per-turn rule. Victory point cards are great to have because they create uncertainty in your opponents (is it a VP or a monopoly card?). [...] Do:- everything you can to get your first city. Liberally trade away sheep/brick/wood to do so. - encourage other players to compete for longest road.- make sure you leave at least one spot open for building a settlement. It is possible to win with 2 cities, largest army and 4 victory point cards, but you'd have to play well and get very lucky.- not get distracted by all that road- and settlement-building. Get those cities out.- hog the ore. Your strategy relies on you having the cities, and

I have been caught off guard far too many times and have struggled to find a way to gain those last Victory Points.¬† My fellow players, however, have clearly planned ahead. For instance, if you‚Äôre counting on the extra points Cities give you as part of your winning strategy, make sure you have good access to ore.¬† If that Longest Road or Largest Army is essential to your win, you need to keep those numbers up so no one steals it away from you. Those unplayed Development Cards start looking more [...] Thing Two: Catan is won by having ten points.¬† Those first two Settlements you placed before the game really started?¬† They‚Äôre worth one point each. That means Catan is really only about scoring eight Victory Points. Eight.¬† Make each point you score ‚Äî and each point you prevent your opponents from scoring ‚Äî count.
Be adaptable in your game plan and smart about each one of those points and, like me, you should find your chances of winning improving with each game.
TagsBoard Game Strategy Guides [...] Given the distribution of the types of Development Cards in the deck, the odds are that you‚Äôre likely to draw a soldier.¬† That‚Äôs not necessarily a bad thing: soldiers can be used to move the Robber off of one of your tiles, or just to move it to a place that will hinder your opponents.¬† Even better, three soldiers gets you the Largest Army card. As with the Longest Road, the Largest Army gets you two Victory Points as long as you can hold onto it until the end of the game.

The concept for the Development Card Strategy is to ignore wood and brick completely when you are placing your initial settlements. Instead, you want, in order, Ore, Wheat, and Sheep. Cities and Development Cards are your friends.  
To achieve 10 victory points, most of the time you'll want to: [...] 3rd Player. Initial placement 5 ore, 4 wheat, 8 wheat, 11 wood, 6 brick. Won. Despite my best efforts to play a Development Card strategy, the best placements for ore and wheat gave me brick and wood, so this one played more like an expansion strategy. I finished with longest road, largest army, 2 cities, 2 settlements, and 1 bonus point.
4th Player. Initial placement 4 ore, 3 wheat, 8 sheep, 5 sheep, 11 sheep. Lost. This strategy is not viable with such low quantities of ore and wheat. [...] Establish one settlement in addition to your starting 2. You'll need to trade for the Wood and Brick that you need or use Year of Plenty, Monopoly, or Road Building to help yourself out.


Turn all three settlements into cities. This should be the easiest part of the strategy considering how much Ore and Wheat you'll be producing.

in this video we're going to go through the development card strategy for Catan so that you can win your next game first part in this strategy is placement now this is the development card strategy so you're going to need wheat sheep and or and these three resources are what you're going to use throughout the game to get development cards so we're going to when you're looking at your first placement try and find a location that is good for that so for example we've got four wheat sheep or sheep [...] to start off with because you want to be wrapping up ranking up your resources but let's say that I was able to trade this to one of my teammates for sheep I'm just gonna place then you'd get another resource card and you've got the start of your army which remember army is only two victory points now a pro of this strategy of focusing on getting development cards is as you're getting development cards there are five victory points in this deck plus you've got the largest army so you have the [...] Catan Development Card Strategy | Strategy Overview

My favorite strategy in Catan is the development card strategy. One of the biggest reasons I love this strategy so much is because I win with this strategy more than any other strategy.

Experienced players often use hidden development cards to scare away other players from blocking and stealing from them, take away another player‚Äôs settlement spot, steal the longest road, shockingly build a city (or two), and even prevent another player from winning on their turn. Development cards offer an additional layer of strategy and players can leverage this favorable information asymmetry to drive the direction of their path to 10 Victory Points.

    new_text: You are playing Settlers of Catan as a grandmaster strategist with expert development card planning. Your task is to analyze the game state thoroughly and choose the optimal action from the available options to maximize your chances of winning.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN by reaching 10 victory points
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>

INITIAL PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- First priority: Target high-probability numbers (6 & 8) on different resources
- Focus heavily on ore and wheat hexes for your initial settlements
- Place settlements on intersections of complementary resources (ore/wheat or wood/brick)
- Between your two settlements, secure at least one good source of each critical resource: ore, wheat, and sheep
- If you must sacrifice a resource, make it brick (unless a brick-port is available)
- Place initial roads toward valuable future expansion areas or resource-rich areas
- Consider ports that match resources you expect to produce in abundance (especially sheep)
- Avoid placing settlements that will be trapped with no expansion opportunities

DEVELOPMENT CARD STRATEGY (PRIMARY PATH TO VICTORY):
- Buy development cards whenever you have excess sheep/wheat/ore
- Development cards provide hidden victory points and tactical advantages
- Use knights strategically to protect your high-producing hexes from the robber
- Save knight cards for when your high-production hexes are blocked by the robber
- Time monopoly cards for when opponents likely have accumulated resources you need
- Use Year of Plenty cards to complete crucial builds when you're short specific resources
- Aggressively pursue largest army (2 VP) if you've already played 2 or more knights
- Aim to secure 3-4 victory point cards throughout the game for a surprise win
- Keep your victory points hidden until you can win in a single turn

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:
- Early-game: Secure minimal expansion to reach critical resource spots or ports
- Mid-game: Focus heavily on ore and wheat to upgrade settlements to cities
- Calculate the VP-to-resource ratio for each potential build (cities give best return)
- Target 2-3 cities before extensive road building, unless going for longest road
- Avoid accumulating 7+ resources before dice rolls
- Never make trades that directly help opponents score immediate points
- Use port trading aggressively rather than accepting unfavorable player trades

ROBBER PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
- Always place the robber on the highest-value hex of the player closest to winning
- Target hexes producing resources you need but can't easily access
- When stealing, prioritize players with cards you need for your next build
- Avoid placing the robber where it equally hurts all players - be strategic
- Don't place the robber on resources you're deficient in - this reduces trading options
- Consider the timing of knight cards - save them for critical moments

PATH TO VICTORY PLANNING:
- Primary Win Path: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
- Alternative Win Path: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP
- Always track your potential hidden victory points vs. visible points
- If you have development cards giving you hidden points, focus on resource gathering
- When you're close to 10 points, calculate whether to reveal victory points immediately
- Keep track of your opponent's visible points AND potential hidden points
- Don't appear to be in the lead until you can win in 1-2 turns

EXPANSION & ROAD STRATEGY:
- Build roads only when they lead to valuable settlement locations
- Prioritize settlements that increase your resource diversity or production probability
- Secure key ports that complement your resource production
- Block opponents' critical expansion paths
- Calculate whether longest road (2 VP) is worth the resource investment
- For each settlement expansion, evaluate whether the resources gained justify the cost

BEFORE MAKING A DECISION:
1. Is there a faster path to 10 victory points?
2. Are development cards a more efficient way to get victory points right now?
3. How will this move position you for the next 2-3 turns?
4. Will this action help or hinder your opponent's strategy?
5. Do you have enough resources to execute your plan for the next few turns?

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)================================= Tool Message =================================

current_prompt.txt updated successfully================================== Ai Message ==================================

Based on my analysis of the game results, performance history, and strategic research, I've made several key improvements to the prompt:

1. **Enhanced Development Card Strategy**: I've made development cards a primary victory path based on our player's strong performance with them. The latest game results showed our player averaging 2.8 development card VPs per game, which was a major factor in winning 3 out of 5 games.

2. **Initial Placement Optimization**: I've refined the initial placement strategy to prioritize ore and wheat hexes even more strongly, as these are critical for both city upgrades and development cards.

3. **Clear Victory Paths**: I've outlined two specific paths to victory:
   - Path 1: 3 cities (6 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + largest army (2 VP) = 10 VP
   - Path 2: 2 cities (4 VP) + 2 settlements (2 VP) + victory point cards (4 VP) = 10 VP

4. **Hidden Victory Points Strategy**: Since development cards offer hidden victory points that surprise opponents at the end, I've emphasized keeping these hidden until you can win in a single turn.

5. **Resource Prioritization**: I've adjusted the resource prioritization to focus on ore, wheat, and sheep, which aligns with the development card strategy.

6. **Knight Card Timing**: Improved guidance on when to use knight cards - both defensively and to build toward largest army.

This revised prompt capitalizes on our player's demonstrated strengths in using development cards while maintaining flexibility in strategy. The prompt now more clearly guides the player to accumulate hidden victory points through development cards while appearing less threatening, which should help maintain our winning advantage against the AlphaBetaPlayer opponent.Evolve Counter: 3
