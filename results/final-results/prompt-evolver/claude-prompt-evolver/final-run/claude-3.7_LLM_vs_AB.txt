Prioritize development cards (ore/sheep/wheat) and city upgrades at my wheat-producing settlement. With the robber on Red's wheat production, I'll have a competitive advantage for wheat access.

With my settlements producing resources well, I'll aim to gather ore and wheat next to upgrade my settlement at node 7 to a city.

    [1] Roll the dice

❓ Select action by number (0-1):

Updated plan: Roll the dice to collect resources first. Save the Knight card for when the robber threatens my high-value production or when I need a specific resource from another player. Continue collecting resources to either build a city (with my existing ore and wheat) or buy more development cards (if I get sheep). Focus on making progress toward city upgrades.

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  Block RED's ore production with the robber to slow their city and development card progress. Focus on collecting resources for development cards, especially targeting the largest army (2 VP). Continue building toward my third city once I have accumulated sufficient ore and wheat. Expand my road network to secure new settlement locations rich in ore and wheat.

TURN 66 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  I need to focus on development cards to catch up with RED. I'll buy a development card now and then focus on securing resources to build settlements at critical locations to improve my production capability. Target next settlement should be near wheat production since my current settlements lack wheat production strength. Long-term goal is to compete for largest army with knights from development cards while building 1-2 cities.
