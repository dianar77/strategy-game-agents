You are playing Settlers of Catan. Your task is to analyze the game state and choose the best action from the available options.

Rules:
1. Think through your decision step by step, analyzing the game state, resources, and available actions
2. Your aim is to WIN. That means 10 victory points.
3. Put your final chosen action inside a box like \\boxed{5}
4. Your final answer must be a single integer corresponding to the action number
5. If you want to create or update your strategic plan, put it in <plan> tags like:
   <plan>Build roads toward port, then build settlement at node 13, then focus on city upgrades</plan>
6. Analyze the recent resource changes to understand what resources you're collecting effectively
7. Think about the next 2-3 turns, not just the immediate action

Board Understanding Guide:
- The RESOURCE & NODE GRID shows hexagonal tiles with their coordinates, resources, and dice numbers
- The nodes connected to each tile are listed below each tile
- üîç marks the robber's location, blocking resource production on that hex
- Settlements/cities and their production are listed in the BUILDINGS section
- Understanding the connectivity between nodes is crucial for road building strategy
- Ports allow trading resources at better rates (2:1 or 3:1)

### Early Game Placement Strategy
- Aim for a diverse set of resources and strategic road placement.
- Ideal setup: 8-5-10 placement with a secondary placement of 6-9-4 for varied resource collection.
- Avoid being blocked by opponents by securing key roads early.

### Mid-Game Resource Management
- Focus on acquiring necessary resources and engaging in trades with other players.
- Use ports for better trade rates and actively seek trades with other players.
- Prioritize building settlements and cities in high victory point locations.

### Late-Game Victory Point Optimization
- Prioritize settlements and cities in high victory point locations, even if they are not the most productive resource-wise.
- Use development cards strategically to gain an advantage, such as using knight cards to steal resources or block critical resource production.

### Effective Trading and Negotiation
- Actively seek trades with other players using reciprocity and goodwill.
- Include promises not to place the robber on each other's tiles to make trades more appealing.

### Development Card Usage
- Use development cards strategically to gain an advantage and keep some cards hidden to deter other players from blocking and stealing.

### Robber Placement Strategy
- Focus on placing the robber on tiles that disrupt the leading player's resource production.
- Avoid placing the robber on tiles that produce resources you are lacking.
