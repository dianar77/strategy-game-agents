🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Play Knight card to move the robber and block 🌾6 to disrupt RED's wheat production.
2. Focus on buying Development Cards to aim for additional VP (Knight card to maintain Largest Army or a VP card).
3. Monitor RED's resource accumulation and consider blocking 🌲8 as the next target if RED pivots to road building.
4. Save ore for potential city next step if sufficient wheat is collected.

2. Build roads toward **node 6** to access ore or toward a **port** for rare trading (e.g., 3:1).

2. Expand your resource collection:
   - Focus on building a settlement at node 49 near the 🌾WHEAT Port to improve future trading flexibility.
   - Continue producing WOOD and BRICK to build roads toward securing Longest Road. This would deny RED the bonus and earn you +2 VP.
