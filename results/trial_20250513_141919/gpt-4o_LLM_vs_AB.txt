🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  Immediately trade 4 🐑SHEEP for 1 ⛏️ORE to work toward upgrading node 13 to a city. Focus on gathering resources to complete the city upgrade. If ore or wheat becomes more available through rolls, expedite this process. Once a city is built, contest Longest Road by saving resources for roads or build development cards for additional VP.

Updated plan: 1. Build roads strategically toward key nodes for ore and wheat. This enables either settlement or trading efficiency. Node 3 (near ⛏️3 ore) is especially critical.
2. Continue targeting RED, as they are the leader. Use the robber to block their most critical resource: 🌾WHEAT.
