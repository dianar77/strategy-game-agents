🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  To continue with the plan of collecting wood to build roads towards Node 27 and the 2:1 wood port, the best action is to move the robber to a tile that maximizes resource disruption for RED while minimizing self-disruption. Additionally, stealing a resource from RED can be beneficial.
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.

TURN 297 | Player: BLUE | Action: MOVE_ROBBER

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  To continue with the plan of collecting wood to build roads towards Node 27 and the 2:1 wood port, the best action is to move the robber to a tile that maximizes resource disruption for RED while minimizing self-disruption. Additionally, stealing a resource from RED can be beneficial.
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.
  To adjust your plan, provide a NEW PLAN in your reasoning with <plan>your new plan</plan>

TURN 1 | Player: BLUE | Action: BUILD_INITIAL_ROAD

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  Given your current resources and the need for 3 more victory points, the best strategy is to build more settlements. You can build a settlement at node 7 or 9, which will give you 1 more victory point. After that, focus on getting the resources to build another settlement or upgrade to a city.
