❓ Select action by number (0-53):

Updated plan: 1. Place my first settlement at Node 9 (🌾10, 🧱8, 🐑11) and build my initial road toward the Wheat Port (Node 28 or 29). This sets me up for efficient Wheat trades.
2. During my second placement, prioritize a strong Ore tile paired with other complementary resources. For example, Node 13 (🌾2, ⛏️5, ⛏️11) is a good candidate for the second settlement.
3. Expand via road-building toward ports and high-value intersections. Secure Wheat Port first for maximum trading efficiency.
4. Once I gather Wheat and Ore, focus on upgrading settlements into Cities to maximize resource intake.
5. Buy Development Cards to build a Knight army and secure Largest Army points for the late game.

❓ Select action by number (0-2):

Updated plan: 1. **Expand toward the Wheat Port**: Building roads toward nodes 28/29 ensures access to the Wheat Port, which will amplify my ability to trade wheat for needed resources like ore and brick in the future. This also blocks opponents from taking the port.
2. **Secure a strong ore/wheat setup** for city-building: My wheat production is decent, so my second settlement placement must focus on adding ore production alongside complementary resources.
3. **Upgrade settlements into cities ASAP**: Cities are essential for exponential resource generation to progress to 10 Victory Points.
4. **Leverage resource trades and development cards**: Buying knights ensures protection and Largest Army points.

❓ Select action by number (0-15):

Updated plan: `:
   - **Play Year of Plenty card** strategically to gain resources for city-building and/or settlement expansion.
   - **Build Roads Toward Wheat Port** at nodes 48-49 to gain access to 2:1 wheat trading.
   - **Focus on upgrading Node 19** to a city for exponential wheat and wood production. 
   - **Buy Development Cards** regularly to pursue Knights (Largest Army strategy).
   - Adjust robber placement (via Knights) to block RED’s wheat/ore production and protect Blue’s key tiles.

#### Available Actions
Since Blue has limited resources (1 ⛏️ORE), the immediate priority is using the **Year of Plenty card** effectively to advance toward city-building or settlement expansion.

#### Evaluating Options for Year of Plenty
- **Critical resources for city-building:** Wheat (🌾) and ore (⛏️) → requires 3 wheat + 2 ore.
- **Available Wheat Port:** Nodes 48-49 (improves wheat trades at 2:1 rate).
- **Optimal resource pairings:**
  - [13] ("WHEAT", "ORE"): Adding wheat and ore directly complements city-building.
  - [9] ("WHEAT", "WHEAT"): Could stockpile wheat for trading at 2:1 (via Wheat Port).
  - [12] ("BRICK", "WHEAT"): Could focus on expanding settlement possibilities and wheat.
  
#### Distracting/Low-Impact Options:
- Resource pairings like [3] ("WOOD", "WOOD") or [5] ("SHEEP", "SHEEP") are less impactful as they don't actively support cities or settlements.

---

### Decision: Choose Action [13]
**Play Year of Plenty card for ('WHEAT', 'ORE'):**  
This directly sets up the resources needed for upgrading Node 19 to a city on subsequent turns and aligns perfectly with my strategic plan.

### Final Strategy
<plan>Play Year of Plenty card to gain wheat and ore. Next, build roads toward Wheat Port (nodes 48-49) to enable efficient trades if wheat production surplus occurs. Focus resources primarily on upgrading Node 19 to a city. Purchase Development cards to secure Knights for Largest Army. Monitor RED’s development and adjust robber placement to block their critical resource production.

Updated plan: , my goal is clear:
1. **Use sheep resources to trade at the Wheat Port until 3 🌾WHEAT are acquired**.
2. Upgrade settlement at **node 0** to a **city**.
3. Focus on scaling cities and disrupting RED’s VP climb using robber placement.

I already have the resources required to achieve **Step 1** of the plan. I need one more **wheat** to proceed with city-building, which can be acquired using resources via port trades.

---

### Step 3: Resource production analysis
From my current settlements:
- Settlement at **node 0** produces **🐑9** (2), **⛏️5** (2), and **🌾5** (2).
- Settlement at **node 49** produces **🧱9** (2) and **🐑6** (3).

I notice that **brick** is being produced at node **49**, along with limited **wheat** at node **0**. **Ore production** is steady at node **0**, so my immediate focus should be on acquiring wheat efficiently via the Wheat Port.

---

### Step 4: Opponent analysis
RED is at **7 Victory Points**, and their production rates show strength in **ore (from city at node 21)** and **wheat (from city at node 21 and settlement at node 18)**. They also have **Longest Road (2 VP)**, which is contributing heavily to their VP score.

RED is a clear threat, and I should prepare to disrupt their resource generation using a Knight card (to reposition the robber) in future turns.

---

### Step 5: Strategic plan adjustment
Given my current resources and the immediate goal of upgrading to a city at **node 0**, I will focus on obtaining the required wheat through port trade. Once the city is built, I will:
<plan>
1. Upgrade settlement at node 0 to a city.
2. Afterward, prioritize expanding roads toward settlement nodes or blocking RED’s expansion while using the Knight card to disrupt RED’s wheat/ore production.
3. Continue securing Largest Army and scaling cities to reach 10 VP.

TURN 28 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  Focus on rolling to gain resources for a city upgrade at node 19. Delay Knight play until RED’s production can be targeted more effectively. Consider trading 3 🌲WOOD for 1 🌾WHEAT if sufficient ⛏️ORE is rolled. Build a city as soon as resources are collected.

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  Upgrade the settlement at node 0 into a city to maximize resource scaling. Use roads to secure additional settlement locations near high-probability tiles. Leverage ports (General Port or 2:1 ⛏️ORE Port) effectively while maintaining Largest Army. Aggressively block RED's resource production using the robber.
