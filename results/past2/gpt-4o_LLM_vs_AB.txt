🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Continue blocking RED’s key resources (🧱9 and 🌾11).
2. Prioritize buying development cards on every eligible turn to aim for Largest Army.
3. Utilize the 🐑 port (once roads expand access) for resource optimization.
4. Expand roads toward 🐑 port and build a settlement when resources allow.
5. Mobilize resources toward upgrading settlement at node 29 into a city (⭐).
6. Guard against RED’s expansion of Longest Road by carefully extending your current longest road from 4 segments to compete if necessary.

- Save any progress toward building roads once resources are accumulated to move toward the 🐑SHEEP port at nodes {40, 44}.
- Focus on purchasing development cards when possible for Largest Army and potential VP gains.

  1. Play Knight card to move robber and steal 1 resource from RED (target Node 22).  
2. Focus on resource collection through dice rolls, especially Wheat, Sheep, and Brick.  
3. Build roads toward Node 21 to establish settlement at General Port.  
4. Use port trading to amass needed resources for further builds (settlement → city upgrades).
