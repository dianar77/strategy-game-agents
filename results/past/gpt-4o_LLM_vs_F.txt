🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Trade 2 🌲WOOD for 1 ⛏️ORE to upgrade node 40 into a city (6 VP → 8 VP with Largest Army).  
2. Focus on building another city (likely at node 6 for its high production of 🌲8 and 🌾4) or purchasing Development Cards to secure Largest Army or gain VP cards. Endeavor to end with 10 VP.  
3. Monitor Red’s 8 roads for Longest Road intervention if needed.

TURN 76 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Continue blocking RED’s 🌾6.  
2. In the next turn, aim to gather resources via rolls or trades to either:
   - Build a settlement (expand resource base).
   - Upgrade to a city for additional points.  
   Strategically, building roads to a new settlement spot (port or high-production node) will be key to expanding quickly.
  To continue with this plan, select the appropriate action.
