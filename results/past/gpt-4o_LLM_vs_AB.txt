🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Focus on collecting ⛏️ORE and 🌾WHEAT for Node 5 city upgrade:
   - Use the 🌲WOOD 2:1 Port if needed to convert abundant 🌲 into required resources.
2. Build roads toward Node 27 for settlement expansion once ORE/WHEAT needs are met.
3. Consider purchasing Development Cards for additional Victory Points and tactical flexibility.

TURN 58 | Player: BLUE | Action: PLAY_TURN

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Play the Knight card to maintain the robber on RED’s critical 🌲6 hex, ensuring it disrupts RED’s high production potential.  
2. Use upcoming resource rolls and the 🌲WOOD port to prioritize obtaining ⛏️ORE and 🌾WHEAT for our **second city upgrade**. Focus on leveraging the port for efficient trades.  
3. After upgrading, consider development cards (for Largest Army) and expanding to new settlement locations.  
4. Monitor RED’s strategy and block them wherever possible to delay their progress toward 10 VP.

🎯 YOUR CURRENT PLAN:
  1. Keep MONOPOLY card as a disruption tool for when RED poses an imminent win threat or to benefit from a high-value resource swing. Target RED’s 🌲WOOD or 🧱BRICK strategically.
2. Roll dice now to increase resource availability; aim to build roads toward the Sheep Port on nodes {25, 26}.
3. Contest Longest Road ASAP to deny RED +2 VP and gain +2 VP.
4. If feasible, upgrade a settlement to a city by trading surplus 🌾WHEAT.
