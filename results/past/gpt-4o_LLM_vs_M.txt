  - Keep blocking RED's 🌾9 by moving the robber to (-1, 1, 0) and stealing (to reduce RED’s resource stockpile). 
- Focus on upgrading settlements at nodes 21 and 24 into cities for victory points. Use the 2:1 🐑Port to trade resources and acquire ⛏️Ore.
- Optionally, build a road toward defensive positioning or potential expansion.

Updated plan: 1. Play Knight card, move the robber to the 🌲6 hex (-1, 0, 1), and steal a resource from RED. This blocks their strongest hex and might disrupt their next move.
2. After rolling dice next turn, aim to use the collected resources and 🐑 Port for efficient trades.
3. Focus on building a **city at node 21** (boost your production of 🌾 and 🐑, gaining an extra point).
4. Progress towards taking Largest Army (2 VP boost). Purchase development cards if possible.
