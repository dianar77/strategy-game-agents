3 phases



-> Resource production phase 
	counterclockwise playing
	when the player roll, on the hex that has that number, we look for a settlement, the owner of the settlement get 1 resource of the hex type
	if player rolls seven, has to give back half of his cards. then choose where to the gray rubber. and the owner of settlements on that hex, has to let him steal one development card.
-> Trade phase
	players can trade between them, 
	also 4 equals resources, can be trade for 1 any resource card on the pile
	on the border if someone has a settlement on a port, there are better trade rates, you can see in the board
-> Build phase
	player exchange the cards for settlement or roads
	each settlement is worth one victory point
	a settlement can be upgraded to city for 2 grain and 3 ore cards
	a city worth 2 victory points
